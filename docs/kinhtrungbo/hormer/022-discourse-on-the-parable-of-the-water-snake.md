# 22. Discourse on the Parable of the Water- Snake

## Alagaddūpama Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Now at that time
 a pernicious view had arisen like this
 in a monk named Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:[1]

 "In so far as I understand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all."
 Several monks heard:

 "A pernicious view has arisen
 to the monk named Ariṭṭha,
 who was formerly a vulture-trainer,
 like this:

 'In so far as I understand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all.'"

 Then these monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha,
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer;
 having approached,
 they spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha,
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:

 "Is it true, as is said, reverend Ariṭṭha,
 that a pernicious view has arisen in you,
 like this:

 'In so far as I understand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all?'"

 "Undoubtedly, your reverences,
 as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all."

 Then these monks,
 anxious to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 from that pernicious view,
 questioned him,
 cross-questioned him,
 and pressed for the reasons,[2] [168]
 and said:

 "Do not speak thus, reverend Ariṭṭha,
 do not misrepresent the Lord;
 misrepresentation of the Lord
 is not at all seemly,
 and the Lord certainly would not speak thus.

 For, in many a figure, reverend Ariṭṭha,
 are things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,[3]
 and in following these
 there is a veritable stumbling-block.

 Sense pleasures are said by the Lord
 to be of little satisfaction,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a skeleton,[4]
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a lump of meat,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.
 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a torch of dry grass,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a pit of glowing embers,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a dream,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to something borrowed,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to the fruits of a tree,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a slaughterhouse,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.
 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to an impaling stake,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord
 to a snake's head,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril."

 Yet the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 even while being questioned,
 cross-questioned
 and pressed for his reasons by these monks,
 expressed that pernicious view as before,
 obstinately holding and adhering to it:

 "Undoubtedly, your reverences,
 as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all."

 Since these monks were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 from that pernicious view,
 then these monks approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 While they were sitting down at a respectful distance,
 these monks spoke thus to the Lord:
 "Lord, a pernicious view like this
 arose in the monk called Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:

 'In so far as I understand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all.'

 And we heard, Lord,
 that a pernicious view like this
 had arisen in the monk called Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:

 'In so far as I understand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all.'

 Then we, Lord,
 approached the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer;
 having approached,
 we spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:

 'Is it true, as is said, reverend Ariṭṭha,
 that a pernicious view has arisen in you like this:

 "In so far as I under- [169] stand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all'?"
 'When this had been said, Lord,
 the monk Ariṭṭha,
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer,
 spoke thus to us:

 "Undoubtedly, your reverences,
 as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all."

 Then we, Lord,
 anxious to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha,
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer,
 from that pernicious view,
 questioned him,
 cross-questioned him,
 pressed him for reasons,
 and said:

 'Do not speak thus, reverend Ariṭṭha,
 do not misrepresent the Lord;
 misrepresentation of the Lord
 is not at all seemly,
 and the Lord certainly would not speak thus.

 For in many a figure, reverend Ariṭṭha,
 are things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 and in following these
 there is a veritable stumbling-block.

 to be of little satisfaction,

 Yet, Lord, the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer,
 even while being questioned,
 cross-questioned
 and pressed for his reasons by us,
 expressed that pernicious view as before,
 obstinately holding and adhering to it:

 "Undoubtedly, your reverences,
 as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all."

 Since we, Lord,
 were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 from that pernicious view,
 we are therefore telling this matter to the Lord."

 Then the Lord addressed a certain monk, saying:

 "Come you, monk,
 summon the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 in my name, saying:

 "'The Lord is summoning you, Ariṭṭha.'"

 "Very well, Lord,"
 and this monk, having answered the Lord in assent,
 approached the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer,
 and having approached,
 spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:

 "The Lord is summoning you, reverend Ariṭṭha."

 "Very well, your reverence,"
 and the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer,
 having answered this monk in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the Lord spoke thus to him:

 "Is it true, as is said,
 that in you, Ariṭṭha,
 a pernicious view [170] arose like this;

 "In so far as I understand dhamma
 taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all'?"

 "Undoubtedly, Lord,
 as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is that in following those things
 called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,
 there is no stumbling-block at all."

 "To whom then do you, foolish man,
 understand that dhamma was taught thus by me?

 Have not things that are stumbling-blocks
 been spoken of by me in many a figure,
 and in following these
 is there not a veritable stumbling-block?

 Sense-pleasures are said by me
 to be of little satisfaction,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a skeleton,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a lump of meat,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a torch of dry grass,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a pit of glowing embers,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a dream,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to something borrowed,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to the fruits of a tree,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a slaughterhouse,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to an impaling stake,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.

 Sense pleasures are likened by me
 to a snake's head,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril."

 And yet you, foolish man,
 not only misrepresent me
 because of your own wrong grasp,
 but also injure yourself
 and give rise to much demerit
 which will be for a long time, foolish man,
 for your woe and sorrow."[5]

 Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "What do you think about this, monks?

 Has the monk Ariṭṭha
 who was formerly a vulture-trainer
 even a glimmering[6] of this dhamma and discipline?"
 "How could this be, Lord?

 It is not so, Lord."

 When this had been said,
 the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 sat down silent,
 ashamed,
 his shoulders drooped,
 his head lowered,
 brooding,
 speechless.

 Then the Lord,
 understanding why the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 was silent,
 ashamed,
 his shoulders drooped,
 his head lowered,
 brooding,
 speechless,
 spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:

 "You, foolish man,
 will be known through this pernicious view of your own,
 for I will now interrogate the monks."

 Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Do you too, monks,
 understand that dhamma was taught by me thus,
 so that the monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 not only misrepresents me
 because of his own wrong grasp,
 but is also injuring himself
 and giving rise to much demerit?"

 [171] "No, Lord.

 For, Lord, in many a figure
 are things that are stumbling-blocks
 spoken of to us by the Lord,
 and in following these
 there is a veritable stumbling-block.

 "It is good, monks,
 it is good that you, monks,
 have thus understood dhamma taught by me.

 For in many a figure
 have things that are stumbling-blocks
 been spoken of by me to you, monks,
 and in following these
 there is a veritable stumbling-block.

 But when this monk Ariṭṭha
 who had formerly been a vulture-trainer
 not only misrepresents me,
 but also injures himself
 and gives rise to much demerit,
 this will be for a long time
 for the woe and sorrow of this foolish man.

 Indeed, monks, this situation does not occur
 when one could follow sense-pleasures
 apart from sense-pleasures themselves,
 apart from perceptions of sense-pleasures,
 apart from thoughts of sense-pleasures.

 Herein, monks, some foolish men
 master dhamma:
 the Discourses in prose,
 in prose and verse,[7]
 the Expositions,[8]
 the Verses,[9]
 the Uplifting Verses,
 the 'As it was Said,'
 the Birth Stories,
 the Wonders,
 the Miscellanies.[10]
 These, having mastered that dhamma,
 do not test the meaning of these things by intuitive wisdom;
 and these things whose meaning is untested by intuitive wisdom
 do not become clear;
 they master this dhamma
 simply for the advantage of reproaching others
 and for the advantage of gossiping,[11]
 and they do not arrive at that goal
 for the sake of which they mastered dhamma.

 These things,
 badly grasped by them
 conduce for a long time
 to their woe and sorrow.

 What is the reason for this?

 [172] Monks, it is because of a wrong grasp of things.

 Monks, it is like[12] a man walking about
 aiming after a water-snake,[13]
 searching for a water-snake,
 looking about for a water-snake.

 He might see a large water-snake,
 and he might take hold of it
 by a coil
 or by its tail;
 the water-snake,
 having rounded on him,
 might bite him on his hand
 or arm
 or on another part of his body;
 from this cause
 he might come to dying
 or to pain like unto dying.
 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, it is because of his wrong grasp of the water-snake.

 Even so, monks,
 do some foolish men here master dhamma:
 the Discourses in prose,
 in prose and verse,
 the Expositions,
 the Verses,
 the Uphfting Verses,
 the 'As it was Said,'
 the Birth Stories,
 the Wonders,
 the Miscellanies.

 These, having mastered that dhamma,
 do not test the meaning of these things by intuitive wisdom;
 and these things whose meaning is untested by intuitive wisdom
 do not become clear;
 they master this dhamma simply for the advantage of reproaching others
 and for the advantage of gossiping,
 and they do not arrive at that goal
 for the sake of which they mastered dhamma.

 These things,
 badly grasped by them
 conduce for a long time
 to their woe and sorrow.

 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, it is because of a wrong grasp of things.

 In this case, monks,
 some young men of family master dhamma;
 the discourses in prose,
 in prose and verse,
 the Expositions,
 the Verses,
 the Uplifting Verses,
 the 'As it was Said,'
 the Birth Stories,
 the Wonders,
 the Miscellanies.

 These, having mastered that dhamma,
 test the meaning of these things by intuitive wisdom;
 and these things whose meaning is tested by intuitive wisdom
 become clear to them.

 They master dhamma
 neither for the advantage of reproaching others
 nor for the advantage of gossiping,
 and they arrive at the goal
 for the sake of which they mastered dhamma.

 These things,
 being well grasped by them,
 conduce for a long time
 to their welfare and happiness.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is, monks, because of a right grasp of things.

 Monks, it is like a man walking about
 aiming after a water-snake,
 searching for a water-snake,
 looking about for a water-snake.

 He might see a large water-snake,
 and he might hold it back skilfully[14]
 with a forked[15] stick;
 having held it back skilfully
 with a forked stick,
 he might grasp it properly
 by the neck.

 However that water-snake, monks,
 might wind its coils round that man's hand
 or arm
 or round another part of his body,
 he would not come to dying
 or to pain like unto dying.

 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, it is because of his right grasp of the water-snake.

 In this case, monks,
 some young men of family master dhamma;
 the discourses in prose,
 in prose and verse,
 the Expositions,
 the Verses,
 the Uplifting Verses,
 the 'As it was Said,'
 the Birth Stories,
 the Wonders,
 the Miscellanies.

 These, having mastered that dhamma,
 test the meaning of these things by intuitive wisdom;
 and these things whose meaning is tested by intuitive wisdom
 become clear to them.

 They master dhamma
 neither for the advantage of reproaching others
 nor for the advantage of gossiping,
 and they arrive at the goal
 for the sake of which they mastered dhamma.

 These things,
 being well grasped by them,
 conduce for a long time
 to their welfare and happiness.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is, monks, because of a right grasp of things.

 Wherefore, monks,
 understand the meaning of what I have said,
 then learn it.

 But in case you do not understand
 the meaning of what I have said,
 I should be questioned about it by you,
 or else those who are experienced monks.

 [173] Monks, I will teach you dhamma  the Parable of the Raft  for crossing over,
 not for retaining.[16]

 Listen to it,
 pay careful attention,
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, Lord,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 "Monks, as a man going along a highway
 might see a great stretch of water,
 the hither bank dangerous[17] and frightening,[17]
 the further bank secure,
 not frightening,
 but if there were not a boat for crossing by
 or a bridge across
 for going from the not-beyond to the beyond,
 this might occur to him:

 'This is a great stretch of water,
 the hither bank dangerous and frightening,
 the further bank secure and not frightening,
 but there is not a boat for crossing by
 or a bridge across
 for going from the not-beyond to the beyond.

 Suppose that I,
 having collected grass,
 sticks,
 branches
 and foliage,
 and having tied a raft,
 depending on that raft,
 and striving with hands and feet,[18]
 should cross over safely
 to the beyond?'

 Then, monks, that man,
 having collected grass,
 sticks,
 branches
 and foliage,
 having tied a raft,
 depending on that raft
 and striving with his hands and feet,
 might cross over safely
 to the beyond.
 To him, crossed over,
 gone beyond,
 this might occur:

 'Now, this raft has been very useful to me.

 I, depending on this raft,
 and striving with my hands and feet,
 crossed over safely
 to the beyond.

 Suppose now that I,
 having put this raft on my head,
 or having lifted it on to my shoulder,
 should proceed as I desire?'

 What do you think about this, monks?

 If that man does this,
 is he doing
 what should be done with that raft?"

 "No, Lord."

 "What should that man do, monks,
 in order to do
 what should be done with that raft?

 In this case, monks,
 it might occur to that man
 who has crossed over,
 gone beyond:

 'Now, this raft has been very useful to me.

 Depending on this raft
 and striving with my hands and feet,
 I have crossed over safely
 to the beyond.

 Suppose now that I,
 having beached this raft on dry ground
 or having submerged it under the water,
 should proceed as I desire?

 In doing this, monks,
 that man would be doing
 what should be done with that raft.

 Even so, monks,
 is the Parable of the Raft
 dhamma taught by me
 for crossing over,
 not for retaining.

 You, monks, [174]
 by understanding the Parable of the Raft,
 should get rid even of (right) mental objects,[19]
 all the more
 of wrong ones.[20]

 Monks, there are these six views
 with causal relations.[21]

 What are the six?

 In this connection, monks,
 an uninstructed average person,[22]
 taking no count of the pure ones,
 unskilled in the dhamma of the pure ones,
 untrained in the dhamma of the pure ones,
 taking no count of the true men,
 unskilled in the dhamma of the true men,
 untrained in the dhamma of the true men,
 regards material shape as:

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'[23]

 he regards feeling as:

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'

 he regards perception as:

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'

 he regards the habitual tendencies as:

 'These are mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'

 he regards consciousness as:

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'

 And also he regards whatever is seen,
 heard,
 sensed,[24]
 cognised,
 reached,
 looked for,
 pondered by the mind as:

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'

 Also whatever view with causal relation says:

 'This the world
 this the self;[25]
 after dying[26]
 I[27] will become permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 I will stand fast like unto the eternal,'

 he regards this as:

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'

 But, monks,
 an instructed disciple of the pure ones,
 taking count of the pure ones,
 skilled in the dhamma of the pure ones,
 well trained in the dhamma of the pure ones,
 taking count of the true men,
 skilled in the dhamma of the true men,
 well trained in the dhamma of the [175] true men,
 regards material shape as:

 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'

 he regards feeling as:

 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'

 he regards perception as:

 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'

 he regards the habitual tendencies as:

 'These are not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'

 he regards consciousness as:

 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'

 And also he regards whatever is seen,
 heard,
 sensed,
 cognised,
 reached,
 looked for,
 pondered by the mind as:

 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'
 Also whatever view
 with causal relation says:

 'This the world
 this the self,
 after dying
 I will become permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 I will stand fast like unto the eternal,'

 he regards this as:

 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self;'

 He, regarding thus that which does not exist,[28]
 will not be anxious."[29]

 When this had been said,
 a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:

 "But Lord, might there not be anxiety
 about something objective
 that does not exist?"[30]

 "There might be, monk,"
 the Lord said.

 "In this case, monk,
 it occurs to somebody:

 'What was certainly mine[31]
 is certainly not mine (now);[32]
 what might certainly be mine,
 there is certainly no chance of my getting.'

 He grieves,
 mourns,
 laments,
 beats his breast,
 and falls into disillusionment.

 Even so, monks,
 does there come to be anxiety
 about something objective
 that does not exist."

 "But might there be, Lord, no anxiety
 about something objective
 that does not exist?"

 "There might be, monk,"
 the Lord said.

 "In this case, monk,
 it does not occur to anybody:

 'What was certainly mine
 is certainly not mine (now);
 what might certainly be mine,
 there is certainly no chance of my getting.'

 He does not grieve,
 mourn,
 lament,
 he does not beat his breast,
 he does not fall into disillusionment.

 Even so, monk,
 does there come to be no anxiety
 about something objective
 that does not exist."

 "But, Lord, might there be anxiety
 about something subjective
 that does not exist?"

 "There might be, monk,'
 the Lord said.

 "In this case, monk,
 the view occurs to someone:

 'This the world
 this the self;
 after [176] dying
 I will become permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 I will stand fast like unto the eternal.'

 He hears dhamma as it is being taught by the Tathāgata
 or by a disciple of the Tathāgata
 for rooting out all resolve for,
 bias,
 tendency
 and addiction to
 view and causal relation,
 for tranquillising all the activities,
 for casting away all attachment,
 for the destruction of craving,
 for dispassion,
 stopping,
 nibbāna.

 It occurs to him thus:
 'I will surely be annihilated,
 I will surely be destroyed,
 I will surely not be.'[33]

 He grieves,
 mourns,
 laments,
 beats his breast,
 and falls into disillusionment.

 Thus, monk, there comes to be anxiety
 about something subjective
 that does not exist."

 "But, Lord, might there be no anxiety
 about something subjective
 that does not exist?"

 "There might be, monk,"
 the Lord said.

 "In this case, monk,
 the view does not occur to anyone:

 'This the world
 this the self,
 after dying
 I will become permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 I will stand fast like unto the eternal.'

 He hears dhamma as it is being taught by the Tathāgata
 or by a disciple of the Tathāgata
 for rooting out all resolve for,
 bias,
 tendency
 and addiction to
 view and causal relation,
 for tranquillising all the activities,
 for casting away all attachment,
 for the destruction of craving,
 for dispassion,
 stopping,
 nibbāna.

 But it does not occur to him thus:

 'I will surely be annihilated,
 I will surely be destroyed,
 I will surely not be.'

 So he does not grieve,
 mourn,
 lament,
 he does not beat his breast,
 he does not fall into disillusionment.

 Thus, monk, does there come to be no anxiety
 about something subjective
 that does not exist.

 Monks, could you take hold of some possession,
 the possession of which would be permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 that would stand fast
 like unto the eternal?

 But do you, monks,
 see that possession
 the possession of which would be permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not able to change,
 that would stand fast
 like unto the eternal?"

 "No, Lord."

 "Good, monks.

 Neither do I, monks,
 see that possession
 the possession of which is permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 that would stand fast
 like unto the eternal.

 Could you, monks,
 grasp that grasping
 of the theory of self,
 so that by grasping that theory of self
 there would not arise grief,
 suffering,
 anguish,

 [177] lamentation,
 despair?

 But do you, monks,
 see that grasping
 of the theory of self,
 from the grasping of which theory of self
 there would not arise grief,
 suffering,
 anguish,
 lamentation,
 despair?"

 "No, Lord."

 "Good, monks.

 Neither do I, monks,
 see that grasping
 of the theory of self
 from the grasping of which
 there would not arise grief,
 suffering,
 anguish,
 lamentation,
 despair.

 Could you, monks,
 depend on that dependence on view,
 depending on which dependence on view
 there would not arise grief,
 suffering,
 anguish,
 lamentation,
 despair?

 But do you, monks,
 see that dependence on view,
 from depending on which dependence on view
 there would not arise grief,
 suffering,
 anguish,
 lamentation,
 despair?"

 "No, Lord."
 "Good, monks.

 Neither do I, monks,
 see that dependence on view
 by depending on which dependence on view
 there would not arise grief,
 suffering,
 anguish,
 lamentation,
 despair.

 If, monks, there were Self,
 could it be said:

 'It belongs to my self'?"[34]

 "Yes, Lord."

 "Or, monks,
 if there were what belongs to Self,
 could it be said:

 'It is my self'?"[35]

 "Yes, Lord."

 "But if Self, monks,
 and what belongs to Self,
 although actually existing,
 are incomprehensible,[36]
 is not the view
 and the causal relation that:

 'This the world
 this the self,
 after dying
 I will become permanent,
 lasting,
 eternal,
 not liable to change,
 I will stand fast
 like unto the eternal'  is not this, monks,
 absolute complete folly?"

 "Lord, how could it not be
 absolute complete folly?"

 "What do you think about this, monks:[37]

 Is material shape
 permanent or impermanent?"[38]

 "Impermanent, Lord."

 "But is what is impermanent
 painful or pleasant?"

 "Painful, Lord."

 "But is it fitting
 to regard that which is impermanent,
 painful,
 liable to change, as

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?"

 [178] "No, Lord."[39]

 "What do you think about this, monks:
 Is feeling
 permanent or impermanent?"

 "Impermanent, Lord."

 "But is what is impermanent
 painful or pleasant?"

 "Painful, Lord."

 "But is it fitting
 to regard that which is impermanent,
 painful,
 liable to change, as

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?"

 "No, Lord."

 "What do you think about this, monks:

 Is perception
 permanent or impermanent?"

 "Impermanent, Lord."

 "But is what is impermanent
 painful or pleasant?"

 "Painful, Lord."

 "But is it fitting
 to regard that which is impermanent,
 painful,
 liable to change, as
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?"

 "No, Lord."

 "What do you think about this, monks:

 Are the habitual tendencies
 permanent or impermanent?

 "Impermanent, Lord."

 "But is what is impermanent
 painful or pleasant?"

 "Painful, Lord."

 "But is it fitting
 to regard that which is impermanent,
 painful,
 liable to change, as

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?"

 "No, Lord."

 What do you think about this, monks:

 Is consciousness
 permanent or impermanent?"

 "Impermanent, Lord."

 "Is that which is impermanent
 painful or pleasant?"
 "Painful, Lord."

 "But is it fitting
 to regard that which is impermanent,
 painful,
 liable to change, as

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?"

 "No, Lord."

 "Wherefore, monks,
 whatever is material shape,
 past, future, present,
 subjective or objective,
 gross or subtle,
 mean or excellent,
 whether it is far or near  all material shape
 should be seen thus
 by perfect intuitive wisdom
 as it really is:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Whatever is feeling,
 past, future, present,
 subjective or objective,
 gross or subtle,
 mean or excellent,
 whether it is far or near  all material shape
 should be seen thus
 by perfect intuitive wisdom
 as it really is:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Whatever is perception,
 past, future, present,
 subjective or objective,
 gross or subtle,
 mean or excellent,
 whether it is far or near  all material shape
 should be seen thus
 by perfect intuitive wisdom
 as it really is:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Whatever are the habitual tendencies,
 past, future, present,
 subjective or objective,
 gross or subtle,
 mean or excellent,
 whether it is far or near  all material shape
 should be seen thus
 by perfect intuitive wisdom
 as it really is:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.
 Whatever is consciousness,
 past, future, present,
 subjective or objective,

 whether it is far or near  all material shape
 should be seen thus

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Monks, the instructed disciple of the pure ones,
 seeing thus,
 disregards material shape,
 disregards feeling,
 disregards perception,
 disregards the habitual tendencies,
 disregards consciousness;
 disregarding,
 he is dispassionate;
 through dispassion
 he is freed;
 in freedom
 the knowledge comes to be
 that he is freed,[40]
 and he comprehends:

 Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more
 of being such or such.
 Monks, such a monk[41]
 is said to have lifted the barrier,[42]
 and he is said to have filled the moat,
 and he is said to have pulled up the pillar,
 and he is said to have withdrawn the bolts,
 and he is said to be a pure one,
 the flag laid low,
 the burden[43] dropped,
 without fetters.

 And how, monks, has a monk
 lifted the barrier?

 In this connection, monks,
 ignorance is got rid of by the monk,
 cut down to the roots,
 made like a palm-tree stump,
 made so that it can come to no [179] future existence,
 not liable to rise again.

 In this way, monks,
 a monk comes to be
 one who has lifted the barrier.

 And how, monks,
 does a monk come to be
 one who has filled the moat?

 In this connection, monks,
 again-becoming,
 faring on in births
 come to be got rid of by a monk,
 cut down to the roots,
 made like a palm-tree stump,
 made so that they can come to no future existence,
 not liable to rise again.
 In this way, monks,
 a monk comes to be
 one who has filled the moat.

 And how, monks,
 does a monk come to be
 one who has pulled up the pillar?

 In this connection, monks,
 craving comes to be got rid of by a monk,
 cut down to the roots,
 made like a palm-tree stump,
 made so that they can come to no future existence,
 not liable to rise again.

 In this way, monks, is a monk
 one who has pulled up the pillar.

 And how, monks,
 does a monk come to be
 one who has withdrawn the bolts?

 In this connection, monks,
 the five fetters binding to the lower (shore)
 come to be got rid of by a monk,
 cut down to the roots,
 made like a palm-tree stump,
 made so that they can come to no future existence,
 not liable to rise again.

 In this way, monks, does a monk come to be
 one who has withdrawn the bolts.

 And how, monks,
 does a monk come to be
 a pure one,
 the flag laid low,
 the burden dropped,
 without fetters?

 In this connection, monks,
 the conceit 'I am'
 comes to be got rid of by the monk,
 cut down to the roots,
 made like a palm-tree stump,
 made so that they can come to no future existence,
 not liable to rise again.

 In this way, monks,
 a monk comes to be
 a pure one,
 the flag laid low,
 the burden dropped,
 without fetters.

 Monks, when a monk's mind is freed thus,
 the devas  those with Inda,[44]
 those with Brahma,[44]
 those with Pajapati,[44]
 do not succeed in their search
 if they think:

 'This is the discriminative consciousness
 attached[45] to a Tathāgata.'[46]

 What is the reason for this?

 I, monks, say here and now
 that a Tathāgata is untraceable.[47]

 [180] Although I, monks, am one who speaks thus,
 who points out thus,
 there are some recluses and brahmans
 who misrepresent me untruly,
 vainly,
 falsely,
 not in accordance with fact,
 saying:

 'The recluse Gotama is a nihilist,[48]
 he lays down the cutting off,
 the destruction,
 the disappearance[49]
 of the existent entity.

 But as this, monks, is just what I am not,
 as this is just what I do not say,
 therefore these worthy recluses and brahmans
 misrepresent me untruly,
 vainly,
 falsely,
 and not in accordance with fact
 when they say:

 'The recluse Gotama is a nihilist,
 he lays down the cutting off,
 the destruction,
 the disappearance
 of the existent entity.'

 Formerly[50] I, monks,
 as well as now,
 lay down simply anguish
 and the stopping of anguish.

 If, in regard to this, monks,
 others revile,[51]
 abuse,
 annoy[52] the Tathāgata,
 there is in the Tathāgata
 no resentment,
 no distress,
 no dissatisfaction of mind[53]
 concerning them.

 If, in regard to this,[54] monks,
 others revere,
 esteem,
 respect
 and honour
 the Tathāgata,
 there is in the Tathāgata
 no joy,
 no gladness,
 no elation of mind[55]
 concerning them.

 If, in regard to this, monks,
 others revere,
 esteem,
 respect
 and honour
 the Tathāgata,
 it occurs to the Tathāgata, monks, concerning them:

 'This that was formerly thoroughly known,[56]
 such kind of duties are to be done by me to it.'[57]

 Wherefore, monks,
 even if others should revile,
 abuse,
 annoy you,
 there should be in you no resentment,
 distress,
 dissatisfaction of mind
 concerning them.

 And wherefore, monks,
 even if others should revere,
 esteem,
 respect,
 honour you,
 there should not be in you joy,
 gladness,
 elation of mind
 concerning them.

 And wherefore, monks,
 even if others should revere,
 esteem,
 respect,
 honour you,
 it should occur to you:

 'This that was formerly thoroughly known,
 such kind of duties are to be done by us to it.'

 [181] Wherefore, monks,
 what is not yours,
 put it away.[58]

 Putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 And what, monks, is not yours?

 Material shape, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Feeling, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Perception, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 The habitual tendencies, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Consciousness, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 What do you think about this,[59] monks?

 If a person were to gather
 or burn
 or do as he pleases
 with the grass,
 twigs,
 branches
 and foliage
 in this Jeta Grove,
 would it occur to you:

 The person is gathering us,
 he is burning us,
 he is doing as he pleases with us?"

 "No, Lord.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is that this, Lord,
 is not our self
 nor what belongs to self."

 "Even so, monks,
 what is not yours,
 put it away;
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 And what, monks, is not yours?

 Material shape, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Feeling, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Perception, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 The habitual tendencies, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Consciousness, monks,
 is not yours;
 put it away,
 putting it away
 will be for a long time
 for your welfare and happiness.

 Thus, monks, is dhamma well taught by me,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings.

 Because dhamma has been well taught by me thus,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings,
 those monks who are perfected ones,
 the cankers destroyed,
 who have lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 laid down the burden,
 attained their own goal,
 the fetter of becoming utterly destroyed,
 and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge  the track of these cannot be discerned.

 Thus, monks, is dhamma well taught by me,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings.

 Because dhamma has been well taught by me thus,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings,
 those monks in whom
 the five fetters binding the lower (shore)
 are got rid of  all these[60] are of spontaneous [182] uprising,
 they are attainers of utter nibbāna there,
 not liable to return from that world.[61]

 Thus, monks, is dhamma well taught by me,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings.
 Because dhamma has been well taught by me thus,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings,
 those monks in whom
 the three fetters are got rid of,
 in whom attachment,
 aversion
 and confusion are reduced,
 all these are once-returners
 who, having come back to this world once,
 will make an end of anguish.

 Thus, monks, is dhamma well taught by me,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings.

 Because dhamma has been well taught by me thus,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings,
 those monks in whom
 the three fetters are got rid of,
 all these are stream-attainers
 who, not liable to the Downfall,
 are assured,
 bound for awakening.

 Thus, monks, is dhamma well taught by me,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings.

 Because dhamma has been well taught by me thus,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings,
 all those monks
 who are striving for dhamma,
 striving for faith[62]
 are bound for awakening.

 Thus, monks, is dhamma well taught by me,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings.

 Because dhamma has been well taught by me thus,
 made manifest,
 opened up,
 made known,
 stripped of its swathings,
 all those who have enough faith in me,
 enough affection,
 are bound for heaven."[63]

 Thus spoke the Lord,
 delighted,
 these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
