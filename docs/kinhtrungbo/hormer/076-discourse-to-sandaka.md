# 76. Discourse to Sandaka

## Sandaka Sutta

#### [513] [192]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Kosambī in Ghosita's monastery.

 Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was staying in the Fig Tree[1] Cave
 with a great company of wanderers,
 with at least five hundred wanderers.

 Then the venerable Ānanda,
 emerging from solitude towards evening,
 addressed the monks, saying:

 "Come, your reverences,
 we will go to Devakaṭa Pool so as to see the Cave."

 "Yes, your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.
 Then the venerable Ānanda,
 together with many monks,
 approached Devakata Pool.

 Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was sitting down
 with the great company of wanderers
 shouting out with a loud noise,
 a great noise,
 talking various kinds of inferior talk,[2]
 that is to say:

 talk on kings,
 thieves,
 great ministers,
 armies,
 fears,
 battles,
 food,
 drink,
 clothes,
 beds,
 garlands,
 scents,
 relations,
 vehicles,
 villages,
 market towns,
 towns,
 the country,
 women,
 heroes,
 streets,
 wells,
 those departed before,
 talk of diversity,
 speculation about the world,
 speculation about the sea,

 [514]talk about becoming or not becoming
 thus or thus.

 The wanderer Sandaka saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance;
 seeing him, he called his own company to order,
 saying:

 "Good sirs, let there be little noise;
 do not, good sirs, make a noise;
 this is a disciple of the recluse Gotama who is coming  the recluse Ānanda.

 For as long as disciples of the recluse Gotama
 have [193] been staying near Kosambī
 the recluse Ānanda has been among them.

 These venerable ones wish for little noise,
 they are trained to little noise,
 they are praisers of little noise.

 So he may consider approaching
 if he knows that this is a company of little noise."

 Then these wanderers fell silent.

 Then the venerable Ānanda approached the wanderer Sandaka.

 The wanderer Sandaka spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:

 "Let the revered Ānanda come,
 there is a welcome for the revered Ānanda;
 it is long since the revered Ānanda made this opportunity,[3]
 that is to say
 for coming here.
 Let the revered Ānanda sit down,
 this seat is ready."

 Then the venerable Ānanda sat down on the seat that was ready.

 And the wanderer Sandaka,
 having taken a low seat,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus
 to the wanderer Sandaka
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "What is the talk
 for which you are now gathered together here, Sandaka?

 And what was your talk
 that was interrupted?"[4]

 "Let be that talk, good Ānanda,
 for which we are now gathered together here.

 It will not be difficult for the good Ānanda
 to hear this talk later.

 It were good if some dhamma-talk
 belonging to his own teacher
 were to occur to the revered Ānanda himself."

 "Well then, Sandaka, listen,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, sir," the wanderer Sandaka answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.

 The venerable Ānanda spoke thus:
 "Sandaka, these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring
 have been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One;
 and four comfortless Brahma-farings
 have been pointed out
 in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled."

 "And what, good Ānanda,
 are these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring
 that have been pointed out
 by the Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 in which [515]an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled?"

 "As to this, Sandaka,
 some teacher speaks thus
 and is of this view:[5]
 'There is no (result of) gift,
 no (result of) sacrifice;
 there is no [194] fruit
 or ripening of deeds
 well done or ill done;
 there is not this world,
 there is not a world beyond;
 there is not (benefit from serving) mother or father;
 there are no beings of spontaneous uprising;
 there are not in the world
 recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly,
 proceeding rightly,
 and who proclaim this world
 and a world beyond,
 having realised them
 by their own super-knowledge.

 This man is derived
 from the four great elements
 so that, when he passes away,
 the earthy part of his body
 returns and relapses to earth,
 the fluid part to water,
 the hot part to heat,
 the windy part to wind,
 and his sense-organs pass over into the ether.

 Four men,
 with a bier as the fifth,[6]
 go along taking the corpse;
 as far as the cemetery
 they make known his characteristics.[7]

 His bones become pigeon-grey.

 Offerings end as ashes.
 It is imbeciles who speak of giving.

 It is vain,
 lying,
 empty talk
 on their part
 who profess to say:

 There is.[8]

 Fools and wise alike
 are annihilated
 and destroyed
 at the breaking up of the body;
 after dying they are not.'

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus:

 'This worthy teacher speaks thus
 and is of this view:

 "There is no (result of) gift,
 no (result of) sacrifice;
 there is no fruit
 or ripening of deeds
 well done or ill done;

 ■

 If this is a true word
 of this good teacher,
 then what is done herein[9]
 is without my doing it,
 what is lived herein
 is without my living it.

 Moreover both of us are herein
 on an exact level in attaining recluseship,
 although I do not say:

 "We will both be annihilated
 and destroyed
 at the breaking up of the body;
 after dying we will not be."

 It is excessive of this good teacher
 to be naked,
 shaven,
 to practise squatting on his heels,
 to pluck out the hair of his head and beard,
 while I am living in a house
 surrounded and supported by sons,
 delighting in Kāsi's sandal-wood perfumes,
 decked with garlands,
 scents
 and unguents,
 enjoying the use of gold and silver.[10]
 For in a future state
 I will be on an exact level in wayfaring[11]
 as this good teacher.

 Knowing what,
 seeing what,
 should I fare the Brahma-faring
 under this teacher?'

 He, realising that this is a way
 of living a non-Brahma-faring,
 goes away uninterested
 in this Brahma-faring.

 This, Sandaka, is the first way of living
 a non-Brahma-faring
 that [195] has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 (a way) in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not [516] live a Brahma-faring
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 And again, Sandaka,
 some teacher here speaks thus
 and is of this view:[12]
 'From doing, from making (another) do,
 from mutilating,
 from making (another) mutilate,
 from threatening,
 from making (another) threaten,
 from causing grief,
 from tormenting,
 from torturing,
 from making (another) torture,
 from making onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what is not given,
 from house-breaking,
 from plundering,
 from robbery,
 from waiting in ambush,
 from going after other men's wives,
 from lying speech —
 from acting (thus) evil is not done.

 If anyone with a discus having an edge sharp as a razor should make the creatures of this earth into one mass of flesh,
 into one heap of flesh,
 from that source there is not evil,
 there is not the perpetuating of evil.

 And if anyone should go to the south bank of the Ganges slaying and striking,
 mutilating,
 making (others) mutilate,
 threatening,
 making (others) threaten,
 from that source there is not evil,
 there is not the perpetuating of evil.

 And if he should go to the north bank of the Ganges giving,
 making (others) give,
 offering,
 making (others) offer,
 from that source there is not merit,
 there is not the perpetuating of merit.

 There is no merit from giving,
 from taming oneself,
 from restraining oneself,
 from truth-speaking,
 there is not the perpetuating of merit.'

 ■

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus:

 'This worthy teacher speaks thus and is of this view:

 "From doing, from making (another) do,
 from mutilating,

 If this is a true word
 of this good teacher,
 then what is done herein
 is without my doing it,
 what is lived herein
 is without my living it.
 Moreover both of us are herein
 on an exact level in attaining recluse-ship,
 although I do not say:

 "Evil will not be done by the deeds of both."

 It is excessive of this good teacher
 to be naked,
 shaven,
 to practise squatting on his heels,
 to pluck out the hair of his head and beard,
 while I am living in a house
 surrounded and supported by sons,
 delighting in Kāsi's sandal-wood perfumes,

 This, Sandaka, is the second way of living
 a non-Brahma-faring
 that has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 (a way) in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 And again, Sandaka, some teacher here speaks thus
 and is of this view:[13]

 'There is no cause,
 no reason for the defilement of creatures,
 creatures are defiled without cause,
 without reason.

 There is no cause,
 no reason for the purification of creatures,
 creatures are purified without cause,
 without reason.

 There is not strength,
 there is not energy,
 there is not human vigour,
 there is not human effort;
 all creatures,
 all breathing things,
 all beings,
 all living things
 are without power,
 without strength,
 without energy,
 bent by fate,
 chance,
 and nature,

 [517] they experience pleasure and pain
 amid the six classes.'

 ■

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus:

 'This worthy teacher speaks thus and is of this view:

 'There is no cause,
 no reason for the defilement of creatures,
 creatures are defiled without cause,
 without reason.

 There is no cause,

 should I fare the Brahma-faring
 under this teacher?'

 He, realising that [196] this is a way
 of living a non-Brahma-faring,
 goes away uninterested
 in this Brahma-faring.

 This, Sandaka, is the third way of living
 a non-Brahma-faring
 that has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 (a way) in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 And again, Sandaka, some teacher here speaks thus
 and is of this view:[14]'

 These seven classes
 are not made
 or caused to be made,
 they are not created
 or caused to be created,
 they are barren (of results),
 standing stable as a mountain,
 stable as a pillar,[15]
 they do not move
 or change
 or injure one another,
 they are unable to affect one another's pleasure
 or pain
 or pleasure-and-pain.

 What are the seven?

 Earth,[16]
 water,
 heat,
 wind,
 pleasures,
 pains,
 life-principles  these seven.[17]

 These seven classes
 are not made
 or caused to be made,
 they are not created
 or caused to be created,
 they are barren (of results),
 standing stable as a mountain,
 stable as a pillar,
 they do not move
 or change
 or injure one another,
 they are unable to affect one another's pleasure
 or pain
 or pleasure-and-pain.

 Herein there is neither slayer
 nor one that makes another slay,[18]
 neither hearer[19]
 nor one that makes another hear,
 neither knower[19]
 nor one that makes another know.

 Even he who cuts off (another's) head
 with a sharp sword
 deprives no one of life,
 for the sword merely penetrates the gap
 between the seven classes.

 There are these fourteen hundred thousand
 chief kinds of birth,[20]
 and sixty hundred
 and six hundred.

 There are five hundred karmas[21]
 and (another) five karmas[22]
 and (another) three karmas.[23]

 There is a karma[24]
 and half a karma.[25]

 There are sixty-two practices,
 sixty-two sub-divisions
 (in a great kalpa[26]),
 six classes [197] of mankind,[27]
 eight stages in (the life of a) man,[28]
 forty-nine hundred modes of livelihood,
 forty-nine hundred wanderers,[29]

 [518] forty-nine hundred nāga-dwellings,[30]
 twenty hundred faculties,
 thirty hundred Niraya Hells,
 thirty-six places where dust collects,
 seven births where there is consciousness,[31]
 seven births where there is no consciousness,[32]
 seven kinds of production
 where there are joints in the stalk,[33]
 seven kinds of devas,[34]
 seven kinds of men,[35]
 seven kinds of demons,
 seven lakes,
 seven knots,[36]
 seven (greater) mountains,
 seven hundred (smaller) mountains,
 seven (great) dreams,[37]
 seven hundred (lesser) dreams.

 There are 84,000 great kalpas
 in which both fools and the wise,
 when they have run on
 and circled on,
 will make an end of anguish.

 It is useless to say:

 "I, by this moral practice
 or habit
 or austerity
 or Brahma-faring[38]
 will bring an unmatured karma to maturity,[39]
 or gradually exhaust karma already matured."[40]

 This is [198] not so.

 Happiness and pain are measured out
 (as) in a bushel;
 circling on has its limits fixed;
 there is not decline and growth,
 there is not high degree or low.[41]
 Indeed, just as a ball of thread,
 when thrown down,
 unwinds itself as it rolls,[42]
 even so will fools and the wise alike,
 when they have run on
 and circled on,
 make an end of anguish.'

 ■

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus:

 He, realising that this is a way
 of living a non-Brahma-faring,
 goes away uninterested
 in this Brahma-faring.

 This, Sandaka, is the fourth way of living
 a non-Brahma-faring
 that has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 (a way) in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 These, Sandaka, are the four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring
 that have been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,

 [519] and in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled."

 "It is wonderful, good Ānanda,
 it is marvellous, good Ānanda,
 that although there are these four ways
 of living a non-Brahma-faring,
 they have been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 as those in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 §

 But now, good Ānanda,
 what are these four comfortless Brahma-farings
 that have been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 and in which an intelligent man
 certainly could not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living [199] it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled?"

 ■

 "As to this, Sandaka,
 some teacher,
 all-knowing,[43]
 all-seeing,
 claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,
 saying:

 'Whether I am walking
 or standing still
 or asleep
 or awake,
 knowledge-and-vision is constantly
 and perpetually before me.'

 He enters an empty place,
 and he does not obtain almsfood,
 and a dog bites him,
 and he encounters a fierce elephant,
 and he encounters a fierce horse,
 and he encounters a fierce bullock,
 and he asks a woman and a man their name and clan,
 and he asks the name of a village
 or a market town
 and the way.

 He, being one who asks,[44]
 'How was this?'

 answers,

 'I had to enter an empty place,
 therefore I entered;
 I had to obtain no almsfood,
 therefore I obtained none;
 (someone) had to be bitten by a dog,
 therefore I was bitten by one;
 (someone) had to encounter a fierce elephant,
 horse
 and bullock,
 therefore I encountered them;
 (someone) had to ask a woman and a man their name and clan,
 therefore I asked;
 (someone) had to ask the name of a village
 and market town
 and the way,
 therefore I asked.'
 Whereupon, Sandaka,
 an intelligent person reflects thus:

 'This revered teacher,
 all-knowing,
 all-seeing,

 saying:

 "Whether I am walking

 'How was this?'

 answers,

 'I had to enter an empty place,

 (someone) had to ask a woman and a man their name and clan,
 therefore I asked;
 (someone) had to ask the name of a village
 and market town
 and the way,
 therefore I asked.'

 Having realised that this Brahma-faring is comfortless,
 he goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring.

 This, Sandaka, is the first comfortless Brahma-faring
 that has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 and [520] in which an intelligent man
 certainly could not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 And again, Sandaka,
 some teacher here depends on report,[45]
 holds to report for his 'truths,'
 he teaches dhamma according to report,[46]
 according to hearsay
 and tradition,
 according to the authority of the collections.[47]

 If a teacher, Sandaka, depends on report,
 holds to report for his 'truths,'
 he remembers (part) well
 and he remembers (part) badly,
 and is both right and wrong.

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus:

 'This worthy teacher depends on report,
 holds to report for his 'truths,'
 he teaches dhamma according to report,
 according to hearsay
 and tradition,
 according to the authority of the collections

 If a teacher depends on report,
 holds to report for his 'truths,'
 he remembers (part) well
 and he remembers (part) badly,
 and is both right and wrong.

 Having realised that this Brahma-faring is comfortless,
 he goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring.

 [200] This, Sandaka, is the second comfortless Brahma-faring
 that has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 and in which an intelligent man
 certainly could not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 And again, Sandaka, some teacher here
 is a reasoner and investigator;[48]
 he teaches dhamma
 on a system of his own devising,
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation.

 If, Sandaka, a teacher is a reasoner and investigator,
 part is well reasoned
 and part is badly reasoned,
 and is both right and wrong.

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus:

 'This worthy teacher

 is stupid and confused;[49]
 because of his stupidity and confusion,
 on being asked a question on this or that

 [521] he falls into equivocation,
 into eel-wriggling:[50]

 'It is not thus for me,[51]
 it is not so for me,
 it is not otherwise for me,
 I do not say it is not,
 I do not say it is not not.'

 Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus:

 'This worthy teacher is stupid and confused
 because of his stupidity and confusion,
 on being asked a question on this or that
 he falls into equivocation,
 into eel-wriggling:

 'It is not thus for me,
 it is not so for me,
 it is not otherwise for me,
 I do not say it is not,
 I do not say it is not not.'

 Having realised that this Brahma-faring is comfortless,
 he goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring.

 This, Sandaka, is the fourth comfortless Brahma-faring
 that has been pointed out
 by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 and in which an intelligent man
 certainly could not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 These, Sandaka, are the four comfortless Brahma-farings that have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 and in which an intelligent man
 certainly could not live a Brahma-faring,
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled."
 "It is wonderful, good Ānanda,
 it is marvellous, good Ānanda,
 that these four comfortless Brahma-farings
 have been pointed out by this Lord
 who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 as those in which an intelligent man
 could certainly not live a Brahma-faring
 or, if living it,
 could not gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 §

 Good Ānanda,
 what does this Teacher teach,
 what does he profess
 whereby an intelligent man

 [201] could certainly live a Brahma-faring
 and, living it,
 could gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled?"

 "As to this, Sandaka, a Tathāgata arises in the world,
 a perfected one,
 a fully Self-awakened one
 endowed with right knowledge and conduct,
 well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 He makes known this world
 with the devas,
 with Māra,
 with Brahmā,
 creation
 with its recluses and brahmans,
 its devas and men,
 having realised them by his own super-knowledge.

 He teaches dhamma which is lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle,
 lovely at the ending,
 with the spirit and the letter;
 he proclaims the Brahma-faring
 wholly fulfilled,
 quite purified.

 A householder
 or a householder's son
 or one born in another family
 hears that dhamma.

 Having heard that dhamma,
 he gains faith in the Tathāgata.

 Endowed with this faith
 that he has acquired,
 he reflects in this way:

 'The household life is confined and dusty;
 going forth is of the open;
 it is not easy for one who lives in a house
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 wholly fulfilled,
 wholly pure,
 polished like a conch-shell.

 Suppose now that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having put on saffron robes,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?'

 After a time,
 getting rid of his wealth,
 be it small or great,
 getting rid of his circle of relations,
 be it small or great,
 having cut off his hair and beard,
 having put on saffron robes,
 he goes forth from home
 into homelessness.

 He, being thus one who has gone forth
 and who is endowed with the training
 and the way of living of monks,
 abandoning onslaught on creatures,
 is one who abstains from onslaught on creatures;
 the stick laid aside,
 the knife laid aside,
 he lives kindly,
 scrupulous,
 friendly
 and compassionate
 towards all breathing things and creatures.
 Abandoning the taking of what is not given,
 he is one who abstains from taking what is not given;
 being one who takes (only) what is given,
 who waits for what is given,
 not by stealing he lives with a self become pure.

 Abandoning unchastity,
 he is one who is chaste,
 keeping remote (from unchastity),
 abstaining from dealings with women.

 Abandoning lying speech,
 he is one who abstains from lying speech,
 a truth-speaker,
 a bondsman to truth,
 trustworthy,
 dependable,
 no deceiver of the world.

 Abandoning slanderous speech,
 he is one who abstains from slanderous speech;
 having heard something here
 he is not one for repeating it elsewhere
 for (causing) variance among these (people),
 or having heard something elsewhere
 he is not one to repeat it there
 for (causing) variance among these (people).

 In this way
 he is a reconciler of those who are at variance,
 and one who combines those who are friends.

 Concord is his pleasure,
 concord his delight,
 concord his joy,
 concord is the motive of his speech.
 Abandoning harsh speech,
 he is one who abstains from harsh speech.

 Whatever speech is gentle,
 pleasing to the ear,
 affectionate,
 going to the heart,
 urbane,
 pleasant to the manyfolk,
 agreeable to the manyfolk  he comes to be one who utters speech like this.

 Abandoning frivolous chatter,
 he is one who abstains from frivolous chatter.

 He is a speaker at a right time,
 a speaker of fact,
 a speaker on the goal,
 a speaker on dhamma,
 a speaker on discipline,
 he speaks words that are worth treasuring,
 with similes at a right time
 that are discriminating,
 connected with the goal.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from what involves destruction to seed-growth,
 to vegetable growth.

 He comes to be one who eats one meal a day,
 refraining at night,
 abstaining from eating at a wrong time.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from watching shows of dancing,
 singing,
 music.
 He comes to be one who abstains
 from using garlands,
 scents,
 unguents,
 adornments,
 finery.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from using high beds,
 large beds.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting gold and silver.

 from accepting raw grain.

 from accepting women slaves and men slaves.

 from accepting goats and sheep.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting fowl and swine.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting elephants, cows, horses, mares.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting fields and sites.
 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting messages or going on such.

 He comes to be one who abstains from buying and selling.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting from cheating with weights.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from accepting from cheating with bronzes.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from cheating with measures.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from the crooked ways of bribery, fraud and deceit.

 He comes to be one who abstains
 from maiming, murdering, manacling, highway robbery.

 He comes to be contented
 with the robes for protecting his body,
 with the almsfood for sustaining his stomach.

 Wherever he goes
 he takes these things with him as he goes.

 As a bird on the wing
 wherever it flies
 takes its' wings with it as it flies,
 so a monk,
 contented with the robes for protecting his body,
 with the almsfood for sustaining his stomach,
 wherever he goes
 takes these things with him as he goes.
 He, possessed of the ariyan body of moral habit,
 subjectively experiences unsullied well-being.

 Having seen a material shape with the eye,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of sight uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of sight,
 he comes to control over the organ of sight.

 Having heard a sound with the ear,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of hearing uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of hearing,
 he comes to control over the organ of hearing.

 Having smelt a smell with the nose,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of smell uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.
 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of smell,
 he comes to control over the organ of smell.

 Having savoured a taste with the tongue,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of taste uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of taste,
 he comes to control over the organ of taste.

 Having felt a touch with the body,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he dwells with this organ of touch uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind,
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of touch,
 he comes to control over the organ of touch.

 Having cognised a mental object with the mind,
 he is not entranced by the general appearance,
 he is not entranced by the detail.

 If he lives with this organ of mind uncontrolled,
 covetousness and dejection,
 evil unskilled states of mind
 might predominate.

 So he fares along controlling it;
 he guards the organ of mind,
 he comes to control over the organ of mind.

 If he is possessed of this ariyan control of the (sense-) organs,
 he subjectively experiences unsullied well-being.

 Whether he is setting out
 or returning,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is looking down
 or looking round,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is bending back
 or stretching out (his arm),
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is carrying his outer cloak,
 his bowl,
 his robe,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is munching,
 drinking,
 eating,
 savouring,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is obeying the calls of nature,
 he is one who comports himself properly;
 whether he is walking,
 standing,
 asleep,
 awake,
 talking,
 silent,
 he is one who comports himself properly.

 Possessed of this ariyan body of moral habit
 and possessed of this ariyan control of the (sense-) organs
 and possessed of this ariyan mindfulness
 and clear consciousness,
 he chooses a remote lodging in a forest,
 at the root of a tree,
 on a mountain slope,
 in a wilderness,
 in a hill-cave,
 in a cemetery,
 in a forest haunt,
 in the open
 or on a heap of straw.

 He, returning from alms-gathering
 after his meal,
 sits down cross-legged
 holding the back erect,
 having made mindfulness
 rise up in front of him.

 He, having got rid of covetousness for the world,
 lives with a mind devoid of coveting,
 he purifies the mind of coveting.

 By getting rid of the taint of ill-will,
 he lives benevolent in mind;
 and compassionate for the welfare
 of all creatures and beings,
 he purifies the mind of the taint of ill-will.

 By getting rid of sloth and torpor,
 he lives devoid of sloth and torpor;
 perceiving the light,
 mindful and clearly conscious,
 he purifies the mind of sloth and torpor.

 By getting rid of restlessness and worry,
 he lives calmly,
 the mind subjectively tranquillised,
 he purifies the mind of restlessness and worry.

 By getting rid of doubt,
 he lives doubt-crossed;
 unperplexed as to the states that are skilled,
 he purifies his mind of doubt.

 He, by getting rid Of these five hindrances  defilements of a mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom  aloof from pleasure of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 enters and abides in the first meditation,
 which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher,

 [522] an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and,
 living it,
 could gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 ■

 And again, Sandaka, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher,
 an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and,
 living it,
 could gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 ■

 And again, Sandaka, a monk,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher,
 an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and,
 living it,
 could gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 ■

 And again, Sandaka, a monk
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher,
 an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and,
 living it,
 could gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 ■

 Thus with the mind composed,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations.

 He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus:

 One birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration:

 'Such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where I was such a one by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.'

 Thus he recollects divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail.

 ■
 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge of the passing hence
 and the arising of beings.

 With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 he sees beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds,
 and thinks:

 'Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.'

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 does he see beings as they pass hence,
 as they arise;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of deeds.

 ■

 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.

 He comprehends as it really is:

 'This is anguish',
 'this is the arising of anguish',
 'this is the stopping of anguish',
 'this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish'.

 He comprehends as it really is:

 'These are the cankers',
 'this is the arising of the cankers',
 'this is the stopping of the cankers',
 'this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers'.

 Knowing thus,
 seeing thus,
 his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures
 and his mind is freed from the canker of becoming
 and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance.

 In freedom the knowledge comes to be:

 'I am freed';
 and he comprehends:

 'Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'

 If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher,
 an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and,
 living it,
 could gain success in the right path,
 in dhamma,
 in what is skilled.

 "But, good Ānanda,
 could that monk who is a perfected one,
 the cankers destroyed,
 who has lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 laid down the burden,
 attained his own goal,
 the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,
 freed by perfect profound knowledge
 [523] could he enjoy pleasures of the senses?"

 "Whatever monk, Sandaka, is a perfected one[52] .,
 the cankers destroyed,
 who has lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 laid down the burden,
 attained his own goal,
 the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,
 freed by perfect profound knowledge  he cannot become one to transgress[53]
 five points:[54]

 a monk whose cankers are destroyed
 cannot become one
 intentionally to deprive a living creature of life

 a monk whose cankers are destroyed
 cannot become one
 to take what has not been given,
 as it were by theft

 a monk whose cankers are destroyed
 cannot become one
 to indulge in sexual intercourse

 a monk whose cankers are destroyed
 cannot become one
 to speak a deliberate lie

 a monk whose cankers are destroyed
 cannot become one
 to enjoy pleasures of the senses
 in [202] regard to what was stored[55]
 as he did formerly
 when in the household state.

 Sandaka, whatever is a perfected one
 the cankers destroyed,
 who has lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 laid down the burden,
 attained his own goal,
 the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,
 freed by perfect profound knowledge  he cannot become one to transgress
 these five points."

 "But, good Ānanda,
 if a monk is one perfected
 the cankers destroyed,
 who has lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 laid down the burden,
 attained his own goal,
 the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,
 freed by perfect profound knowledge  then, whether he is walking
 or standing still
 or asleep
 or awake
 is the knowledge-and-vision constantly
 and perpetually present
 that his cankers are destroyed?"

 "Well then, Sandaka, I will make you a simile,
 for by a simile some intelligent persons here
 understand the meaning of what has been said.

 Sandaka, it is like a man
 whose hands and feet have been cut off;
 whether he is walking
 or standing still
 or asleep
 or awake,
 constantly and perpetually
 are his hands and feet
 as though cut off;
 and moreover
 while he is reflecting on it,
 he knows:

 'My hands and feet have been cut off.'

 Even so, Sandaka,
 whatever monk is a perfected one,
 the cankers destroyed,
 who has lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 laid down the burden,
 attained his own goal,
 the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,
 freed by perfect profound knowledge,
 for him
 whether he is walking
 or standing still
 or asleep
 or awake,
 the cankers are as though destroyed;
 and moreover
 while he is reflecting on it,
 he knows:

 'My cankers are destroyed.'"

 "How many great leaders,[56] good Ānanda,
 are there in this dhamma and discipline?"

 "Not merely a hundred,
 nor two,
 three,
 four
 or five hundred,
 but far more are those
 who are great leaders
 in this dhamma and discipline."

 "Wonderful, good Ānanda,
 marvellous, good Ānanda;
 there can be no extolling of their own dhamma
 nor disparaging of the dhamma of others;
 but both the teaching of dhamma in its (whole) extent[57]
 and so [524] many great leaders can be seen.

 On the other hand,
 these Naked Ascetics
 are children of a childless mother,
 they both extol themselves
 and disparage others,
 and they show only three great leaders,
 namely Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca and Makkhali Gosāla"[58]
 Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own company, saying:

 "Let the good sirs fare forth;
 the living of the Brahma-faring
 is [203] under the recluse Gotama,
 although it is not easy for us now
 to give up gains,
 honours,
 fame."

 It was in this way
 that the wanderer Sandaka
 sent his own company
 into the Lord's Brahma-faring.

 Discourse to Sandaka:
 The Sixth[59]
