# 147. Discourse on an Exhortation to Rāhula

## Cūḷa Rāhul'ovāda Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time[1] the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then as the Lord was in solitary meditation
 a reasoning arose in his mind thus:

 "Mature now in Rāhula
 are the things[2] that bring freedom to [329] maturity.[3]

 Suppose I were to train Rahula further
 in the destruction of the cankers?"

 And having dressed in the early morning
 the Lord, taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.
 When he had walked in Sāvatthī for almsfood,
 on returning from the alms-gathering after the meal
 he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:

 "Take your piece of cloth for sitting on,[4] Rāhula;
 we will go to the Blind Men's Grove[5]
 for the day-sojourn."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 answered the venerable Rāhula
 in assent to the Lord
 and, taking his piece of cloth for sitting on,
 he followed closely after the Lord.

 Now at that time
 various thousands of devas were following the Lord,
 thinking:

 "Today the Lord will train the venerable Rāhula further
 in the destruction of the cankers."

 Then the Lord plunged into the Blind Men's Grove
 and sat down on a seat made ready
 at the root of a tree.

 And the venerable Rāhula,
 having greeted the Lord,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus
 to the venerable Rahula
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 Seeing thus, Rāhula,
 the instructed disciple of the ariyans
 turns away from the eye,
 he turns away from material shapes,
 he turns away from visual consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the eye;
 and likewise he turns away
 from that which arises because of impact on the eye
 as feeling,
 perception,
 the habitual tendencies,
 consciousness.

 ■

 He turns away from the ear,
 he turns away from sounds;
 he turns away from auditory consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the ear;
 and likewise he turns away
 from that which arises because of impact on the ear
 as feeling,
 perception,
 the habitual tendencies,
 consciousness.

 ■

 He turns away from the nose,
 he turns away from smells;
 he turns away from olfactory consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the nose;
 and likewise he turns away
 from that which arises because of impact on the nose
 as feeling,
 perception,
 the habitual tendencies,
 consciousness.

 ■

 He turns away from the tongue,
 he turns away from tastes;
 he turns away from gustatory consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the tongue;
 and likewise he turns away
 from that which arises because of impact on the tongue
 as feeling,

 as feeling,

 he turns away from mental consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the mind;
 and likewise he turns away
 from that which arises because of impact on the mind
 as feeling,
 perception,
 the habitual tendencies,
 consciousness.

 §
 In turning away he is dispassionate;
 by dispassion he is freed;
 in freedom is the knowledge that he is freed,
 and he comprehends:

 Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 The venerable Rāhula rejoiced in what the Lord had said.

 While this exposition was being given
 the venerable Rāhula's mind was freed from the cankers without grasping.

 And to those various thousands of devas
 there arose the dustless,
 stainless vision of dhamma[6] that,

 'whatever is liable to uprising
 all that is liable to stopping.'
