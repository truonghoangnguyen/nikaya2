# 84. Discourse at Madhura

## Madhurā Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the venerable Kaccāna the Great was staying near Madhurā in the Gundā Grove.[1]

 Avantiputta,[2] king of Madhurā, heard that the recluse Kaccāna was staying near Madhurā in the Gundā Grove and
 that of that revered Kaccāna
 a lovely report had gone forth thus:

 'He is clever,
 experienced,
 wise,
 one who has heard much,
 a brilliant speaker,
 of lovely intelligence,
 senior
 as well as being a perfected one.

 Good is the sight of perfected ones like this.'

 Then Avantiputta, king of Madhurā,
 having had many splendid vehicles harnessed,
 having mounted a splendid vehicle,
 set out from Madhurā
 with the many splendid vehicles
 and with great royal pomp
 so as to see the venerable Kaccāna the Great.

 He went by vehicle as long as the ground was passable,
 then, having dismounted from the vehicle,
 he approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great on foot;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Kaccāna the Great;
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Avantiputta, king of Madhurā,
 spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:

 "Good Kaccāna,
 brahmans speak thus:

 'Only brahmans form the best caste,
 all other castes are low;
 only brahmans form the fair caste,
 all other casts are dark;
 only brahmans are pure,
 not non-brahmans;
 brahmans are own sons of Brahmā,
 born of his mouth,
 born of Brahmā, formed by Brahmā, heirs to Brahmā.'[3]

 What does the reverend Kaccāna say to this?"

 "Sire, this is merely a sound in the world, that:

 'Only brahmans [274] form the best caste,
 all other castes are low;
 only brahmans form the fair caste,
 all other casts are dark;
 only brahmans are pure,
 not non-brahmans;
 brahmans are own sons of Brahmā,
 born of his mouth,
 born of Brahmā, formed by Brahmā, heirs to Brahmā.'

 This is a way in which it can be said, sire, that this is merely a sound in the world, that:

 'Only brahmans form the best caste,
 all other castes are low;
 only brahmans form the fair caste,
 all other casts are dark;
 only brahmans are pure,
 not non-brahmans;
 brahmans are own sons of Brahmā,
 born of his mouth,
 born of Brahmā, formed by Brahmā, heirs to Brahmā.'

 What do you think about this, sire?

 Even if a noble were to thrive in wealth or corn or gold or silver,
 could he have as his obedient servant another noble to get up earlier than he would,
 to go later to rest,
 carrying out his pleasure,
 speaking affably,[4]
 or could he have a brahman
 or could he have a merchant
 or could he have a worker
 to get up earlier than he would,
 to go later to rest,
 carrying out his pleasure,
 speaking affably?"

 "Good Kaccāna, if a noble were to thrive in wealth or corn or gold or silver
 he could have as his obedient servant a noble to get up earlier than he would,
 to go later to rest,
 carrying out his pleasure,
 speaking affably,
 or he could have a brahman,
 or he could have a merchant,
 or he could have a worker
 to get up earlier than he would,
 to go later to rest,
 carrying out his pleasure,
 speaking affably."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Even if a worker were to thrive in wealth or corn or gold or silver,
 could he have as his obedient servant another worker to get up earlier than he would,
 to go later to rest,
 carrying out his pleasure,

 or could he have a brahman

 speaking affably."

 [275] "What do you think about this, sire?

 This being so,
 are these four castes exactly the same or not?

 Or how does this seem to you?"

 "Indeed, good Kaccāna,
 this being so,
 these four castes are exactly the same;
 I do not see any difference between them in this respect."

 "This is a way in which it can be said, sire, that this is merely a sound in the world, that:

 What do yon think about this, sire?

 If a noble made onslaught on creatures here,
 took what had not been given,
 wrongly enjoyed pleasures of the senses,
 were a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 of wrong view  would he at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arise in the sorrowful way,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell?

 Or not?

 Or how does this seem to you?"

 When this had been said, Avantiputta, king of Madhurā,
 spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:

 "Excellent, good Kaccāna,
 excellent, good Kaccāna.

 It is as if one might set upright
 what had been upset,[10]
 or might disclose what was covered,
 or show the way to one who had gone astray,
 or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so in many a figure has dhamma been made clear by the good Kaccāna.

 Thus I am going to the revered Kaccāna for refuge
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the revered Kaccāna accept me as a lay-disciple
 going for refuge from today forth
 for as long as life lasts."

 "But do not you, sire, go for refuge to me.

 You must go for refuge
 only to that Lord to whom I have gone for refuge."
 "But where, good Kaccāna, is this Lord staying now,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One?"

 "Sire, this Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 has now attained final nibbāna."

 "Good Kaccāna, if we should hear that that Lord were ten ... twenty thirty ... forty ... fifty yojana distant we should go the fifty yojana
 so as to see that Lord.

 And, good Kaccāna,
 even if we heard that the Lord were a hundred yojana distant,
 we should go the hundred yojana
 so as to see that Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 But, good Kaccāna,
 since the Lord has attained final nibbāna,
 we are going for refuge to that Lord
 who has attained final nibbana
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the revered Kaccāna accept me as a lay-disciple
 going for refuge from today forth
 for as long as life lasts."
