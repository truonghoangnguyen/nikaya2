# 103. Discourse on "What Then?"

## Kinti Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Kusinārā
 in the Wood of the Offerings.[1]

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "What then is there for you, monks, in me?

 Is it that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of robe-material
 or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of almsfood
 or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of lodgings
 or that the [25] recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of success or decline[2] in this or that?"

 "No, Lord; we do not think:
 'The recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of almsfood
 or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of lodgings
 or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of success or decline in this or that.'"

 "Certainly, monks, there is not this for you in me:
 that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of almsfood
 or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of lodgings
 or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 for the sake of success or decline in this or that.

 So what then is there, monks, for you in me?"

 "It is thus, Lord, in the Lord for us:

 The Lord, compassionate,
 seeking welfare,
 teaches dhamma out of compassion."

 "Certainly, monks, it is thus for you in me:

 The Lord, compassionate,
 seeking welfare,
 teaches dhamma out of compassion.
 Wherefore, monks, those things taught to you by me
 out of superknowledge,[3]
 that is to say
 the four applications of mindfulness,
 the four right efforts,
 the four bases of psychic power,
 the five controlling faculties,
 the five powers,
 the seven links in awakening,
 the ariyan eightfold Way  all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention
 you should train yourselves in each and all of these.

 But when you, monks, all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention
 have trained yourselves in these,
 there might be two monks speaking differently
 about Further-dhamma.[4]

 If it should occur to you concerning this:

 'Between these venerable ones
 there is a difference as to denotation
 and a difference as to connotation,'

 then, approaching that monk
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:
 'Between the venerable ones
 there is a difference as to denotation
 and a difference as to connotation,
 on account of which these venerable ones should know
 that there is a difference as to denotation
 and a difference as to connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention.'

 After this,
 having approached whatever monk on the other side
 of the factious monks
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:

 'Between the venerable ones
 there is a difference as to denotation
 and a [26] difference as to connotation,
 on account of which these venerable ones should know
 that there is a difference as to denotation
 and a difference as to connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention.'

 In this way what is hard to grasp
 should be remembered as hard to grasp;
 having remembered what is hard to grasp
 as hard to grasp,
 that which is dhamma,
 that which is discipline
 should be spoken.

 ■

 If it should occur to you concerning this,[5]
 'Although there is a difference between these venerable ones as to denotation,
 there is agreement as to connotation,'

 then having approached that monk
 whose speech you deem to be the more pleasing,
 you should speak to him thus:

 'Although these venerable ones
 differ as to denotation,
 there is agreement as to connotation,
 therefore these venerable ones should know
 that although they differ as to denotation,
 there is agreement as to connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention.'

 After this,
 having approached whatever monk on the other side
 of the factious monks
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:

 'Although these venerable ones
 differ as to denotation,
 there is agreement as to connotation,
 therefore these venerable ones should know
 that although they differ as to denotation,
 there is agreement as to connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention.'

 In this way what is hard to grasp
 should be remembered as hard to grasp;
 having remembered what is hard to grasp
 as hard to grasp,
 that which is dhamma,
 that which is discipline
 should be spoken.

 ■

 If it should occur to you concerning this,

 'Although there is agreement between these venerable ones as to denotation,
 there is difference as to connotation,'

 then having approached that monk
 whose speech you deem to be the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:

 'Between the venerable ones
 there is agreement as to denotation,
 there is difference as to connotation,
 on account of which these venerable ones should know
 that there is agreement as to denotation,
 difference as to connotation.

 But this is a mere trifle,
 that is to say connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention over a mere trifle.'

 After this,
 having approached whatever monk on the other side
 of the factious monks
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:

 'Between these venerable ones
 there is agreement as to denotation,
 there is difference as to connotation,
 on account of which these venerable ones should know
 that there is agreement as to denotation,
 difference as to connotation.

 But this is a mere trifle,
 that is to say connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall [27] into contention over a mere trifle.'

 In this way what is easy to grasp
 should be remembered as easy to grasp;
 what is hard to grasp should be remembered as hard to grasp;
 having remembered what is easy to grasp
 as easy to grasp,
 having remembered what is hard to grasp
 as hard to grasp,
 that which is dhamma,
 that which is discipline
 should be spoken.

 ■

 If it should occur to you concerning this:

 'Between these venerable ones
 there is agreement as to denotation
 and there is agreement as to connotation,'

 then having approached that monk
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:

 'Between the venerable ones
 there is agreement as to denotation
 and there is agreement as to connotation,
 on account of which
 these venerable ones should know
 that there is agreement as to denotation
 and agreement as to connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention.'

 After this,
 having approached whatever monk on the other side
 of the factious monks
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus to him:

 'Between the venerable ones
 there is agreement as to denotation
 and there is agreement as to connotation,
 on account of which
 these venerable ones should know
 that there is agreement as to denotation
 and agreement as to connotation.

 Do not let the venerable ones fall into contention.'

 In this way what is easy to grasp
 should be remembered as easy to grasp;
 what is hard to grasp should be remembered as hard to grasp;
 having remembered what is easy to grasp
 as easy to grasp,
 having remembered what is hard to grasp
 as hard to grasp,
 that which is dhamma,
 that which is discipline
 should be spoken.
 And when you, monks,
 all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention
 are trained in these,
 a certain monk might have an offence,
 might have a transgression.

 As to this, monks,
 one should not hasten with reproof  the individual must be examined.

 (You may think):

 'There will be no vexation for me
 nor annoyance for the other individual;
 for if the other individual is without wrath,
 without rancour,
 is of quick view
 and easy to convince,
 I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.'

 If it occurs to you thus, monks,
 it is right to speak.

 ■

 But if you think, monks,

 'There will be no vexation for me
 but (there will be) annoyance for the other individual;
 for though the other individual is wrathful,
 rancorous,
 of slow view
 (but) easy to convince,
 I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.

 For this is a mere trifle,
 that is to say
 the other individual's annoyance.

 And this is of the greater moment,
 that I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.'

 If it occurs to you thus, monks,
 it is right to speak.

 ■

 But if you think, monks:

 'There will be vexation for me
 but no annoyance for the other individual;
 for if the other individual is [28] without wrath,
 without rancour,
 is of quick view
 though hard to convince,
 I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.

 For this is a mere trifle,
 that is to say my vexation.

 And this is of the greater moment,
 that I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.'
 If it occurs to you thus, monks,
 it is right to speak.

 ■

 But if you think, monks:

 'There will be vexation for me
 and annoyance for the other individual;
 yet though the other individual is wrathful,
 rancorous,
 of slow view
 and hard to convince,
 I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.

 For this is a mere trifle,
 that is to say
 my vexation
 and the other individual's annoyance.

 And this is of the greater moment,
 that I have the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill.'

 If it occurs to you thus, monks,
 it is right to speak.

 ■

 But if you think, monks:

 'There will be vexation for me
 and annoyance for the other individual;
 for the other individual is wrathful,
 rancorous,
 of slow view
 and hard to convince,
 and I have not the power
 to raise this individual from unskill
 and establish him in what is skill'
 -equanimity, monks,
 should not be disdained
 for such an individual.

 And when you, monks,
 all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention
 have trained yourselves in these
 there might arise between you
 an activity of speech,[6]
 an offensive view,
 malice in thought,
 discontent,
 dissatisfaction.

 ■

 In that case,
 having approached that monk
 whom you deem the more easy
 of the factious monks
 to speak to,
 you should speak to him thus:
 'Although, your reverence,
 we were trained all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention,
 there has arisen between us
 an activity of speech,
 an offensive view,
 malice in thought,
 discontent,
 dissatisfaction
 for which the Recluse,[7]
 knowing of it,
 would blame us.'

 Answering aright, monks,
 the monk would answer thus:

 'Although, your reverence,
 we were trained all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention,
 there has arisen between us
 an activity of speech,
 an offensive view,
 malice in thought,
 discontent,
 dissatisfaction
 for which the Recluse,
 knowing of it,
 would blame us.

 But without getting rid of this condition,[8] your reverence,
 could nibbāna be realised?'

 Answering aright, monks,
 the monk would answer thus:
 'Without getting rid of this condition,
 your reverence,
 nibbāna could not be realised.'

 After this,
 having approached whatever monk on the other side
 of the factious monks
 whose speech you deem the more pleasing,
 you should speak thus [29] to him:

 'Although, your reverence,
 we were trained all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention,
 there has arisen between us
 an activity of speech,
 an offensive view,
 malice in thought,
 discontent,
 dissatisfaction
 for which the Recluse,
 knowing of it,
 would blame us.'

 Answering aright, monks,
 the monk would answer thus:

 'Although, your reverence,
 we were trained all together,
 in harmony
 and without contention,
 there has arisen between us
 an activity of speech,
 an offensive view,
 malice in thought,
 discontent,
 dissatisfaction
 for which the Recluse,
 knowing of it,
 would blame us.

 But without getting rid of this condition, your reverence,
 could nibbāna[9] be realised?'

 Answering aright, monks,
 the monk in answering[10]
 would answer thus:

 'Without getting rid of this condition,
 your reverence,
 nibbāna could not be realised.'

 If, monks, others should ask that monk,
 saying:

 'Were these monks raised up from unskill
 and established in skill
 by the venerable one?

 answering aright, monks,
 the monk would answer thus:

 'I, your reverences,
 approached the Lord;
 the Lord taught me his dhamma;
 when I had heard that dhamma,
 I spoke it to those monks;
 when those monks had heard that dhamma
 they rose up from unskill
 and established themselves in what is skill.'

 Answering thus, monks,
 the monk neither exalts himself
 nor disparages another,
 he is explaining in accordance with dhamma,
 and no one of his fellow dhamma-men,
 of his way of speaking,
 gives grounds for reproach."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
