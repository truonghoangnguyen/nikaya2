# 115. Discourse on the Manifold Elements

## Bahu-Dhātuka Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:[1]

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Whatever fears arise, monks,
 all arise for the fool,
 not the wise man.
 Whatever troubles[2] arise,
 all arise for the fool,
 not the wise man.

 Whatever misfortunes arise,
 all arise for the fool,
 not the wise man.

 Monks, as a spark of fire[3]
 from a house thatched with rushes
 or a house thatched with grass
 sets fire to gabled houses
 that [105] are smeared inside and out,
 protected from the wind,
 with bolts that are fastened,
 windows that are closed,[4]
 even so, monks, whatever fears arise, monks,
 all arise for the fool,
 not the wise man;
 whatever troubles arise,
 all arise for the fool,
 not the wise man;
 whatever misfortunes arise,
 all arise for the fool,
 not the wise man.

 Thus, monks, it is the fool
 who is beset by fear,
 the wise man is not beset by fear;
 the fool has trouble,
 the wise man does not have trouble;
 the fool has misfortune,
 the wise man does not have misfortune.

 Monks, there is not fear,
 trouble,
 misfortune
 for the wise man.

 Wherefore, monks, thinking,

 'Investigating,
 we will become wise,'

 this is how you must train yourselves, monks."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:

 "What is the stage at which it suffices to say, revered sir:

 'Investigating, the monk is wise'?"

 "Ānanda, as soon as a monk is skilled in the elements
 and skilled in the (sense-)fields
 and skilled in conditioned genesis
 and skilled in the possible and the impossible,[5]
 it is at this stage, Ānanda,
 that it suffices to say,
 'Investigating, the monk is wise.'"

 "But, revered sir, at what stage
 does it suffice to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"

 "There are these eighteen elements,[6] Ānanda:

 the element of eye,
 the element of material shape,
 the element of visual consciousness;

 the element of ear,
 the element of sound,
 the element of auditory consciousness;

 the element of nose,
 the element of smell,
 the element of olfactory consciousness;

 the element of tongue,
 the element of taste,
 the element of gustatory consciousness;

 the element of body,
 the element of touch,
 the element of bodily consciousness;

 the element of mind,
 the element of mental states,
 the element of mental consciousness.

 When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these eighteen elements,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"

 ■

 "Might there be another way also, revered sir,
 according to which it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"

 "There might be, Ānanda.

 There are these six elements, Ānanda:

 the element of extension,
 the element of cohesion,
 the element of radiation,
 the element of mobility,[7]
 the element of space,
 the element of consciousness.[8]

 When, Ānanda, he knows and sees [106] these six elements,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"

 ■

 "Might there be another way also, revered sir,
 according to which it suffices to say,

 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"

 "There might be, Ānanda.

 There are these six elements, Ānanda:

 the element of happiness,
 the element of anguish,
 the element of gladness,
 the element of sorrowing,
 the element of equanimity,
 the element of Ignorance.[9]
 When, Ãnanda, he knows and sees these six elements,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"

 ■

 "Might there be another way also, revered sir,
 according to which it suffices to say,

 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"

 "There might be, Ānanda.

 There are these six elements, Ānanda:

 the element of sensuous pleasures,
 the element of renunciation,
 the element of malice,
 the element of non-malice,
 the element of harming,
 the element of non-harming.[10]

 When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these six elements,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"

 ■

 "Might there be another way also, revered sir,
 according to which it suffices to say,

 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"

 "There might be, Ānanda.
 There are these three elements, Ānanda:

 the element of sensuous pleasures,
 the element of fine-materiality,
 the element of non-materiality.[11]

 When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these three elements,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"

 ■

 "Might there be another way, revered sir,
 according to which it suffices to say,

 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"

 "There might be, Ānanda.

 There are these two elements, Ānanda:

 the element that is constructed[12]
 and the element that is unconstructed.

 When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these two elements,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"

 "At what stage, revered sir,
 does it suffice to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the (sense-)fields'?"

 "These six (sense-)fields, Ānanda,
 are internal-external:

 the eye [107] as well as material shape;
 the ear as well as sound;
 the nose as well as smell;
 the tongue as well as taste;
 the body as well as touch;
 the mind as well as mental states.

 When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these six internal-external (sense-)fields,
 it is at this stage
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in the (sense-)fields.'"

 "And at what stage, revered sir,
 does it suffice to say,

 'The monk is skilled in conditioned genesis'?"

 "As to this, Ānanda, a monk knows thus:

 'If this is,
 that comes to be;
 from the arising of this,
 that arises;

 if this is not,
 that does not come to be;
 from the stopping of this,
 that is stopped.

 That is to say:

 Conditioned by ignorance are the (karma-)formations;[13]
 conditioned by the (karma-)formations is consciousness;
 conditioned by consciousness is name-and-shape;
 conditioned by name-and-shape is the field of the six (senses);
 conditioned by the field of the six (senses) is (sensory) impingement;
 conditioned by (sensory) impingement is feeling;
 conditioned by feeling is craving;
 conditioned by craving is grasping;
 conditioned by grasping is becoming;
 conditioned by becoming is birth;
 conditioned by birth there come into being
 old age and dying,
 grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair.

 Thus is the origin
 of this whole mass of anguish.

 But from the utter fading away and stopping
 of this very ignorance
 is the stopping of the (karma-)formations;
 from the stopping of the (karma-)formations
 is the stopping of consciousness;
 from the stopping of consciousness
 is the stopping of name-and-shape;
 from the stopping of name-and-shape
 is the stopping of the field of the six (senses);
 from the stopping of the field of the six (senses)
 is the stopping of (sensory) impingement;
 from the stopping of (sensory) impingement
 is the stopping of feeling;
 from the stopping of feeling
 is the stopping of craving;
 from the stopping of craving
 is the stopping of grasping;
 from the stopping of grasping
 is the stopping of becoming;
 from the stopping of becoming
 is the stopping of birth;
 from the stopping of birth,
 old age and dying,
 grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are stopped.

 Thus is the stopping
 of this whole mass of anguish.'

 It is at that stage, Ānanda,
 that it suffices to say,
 'The monk is skilled in conditioned genesis.'"

 ■

 "And at what stage, revered sir,
 does it suffice to say,

 'The monk is skilled in the possible and the impossible'?"

 "As to this, Ānanda, a monk comprehends:
 'It is impossible,
 it cannot come to pass[14]
 that a man possessed of (right) view

 'It is impossible,
 it cannot come to pass
 that in one world-system
 two perfected ones
 who are Fully Self-Awakened Ones

 'But this situation occurs
 that in one world-system
 one perfected one
 who is a Fully Self-Awakened Ones
 might arise  this situation occurs.'

 ■

 He comprehends:

 'It is impossible,
 it cannot come to pass

 two wheel-turning kings

 one wheel-turning king
 might arise  this situation occurs.'

 ■

 He comprehends:

 'It is impossible,
 it cannot come to pass
 that a woman who is a perfected one

 ■

 He comprehends:

 ■

 He comprehends:

 'It is impossible,
 it cannot come to pass
 that one who is addicted to wrong conduct in body
 should, from that source,
 from that condition
 arise, on the breaking up of the body after dying,
 in a good bourn, a heaven world  this situation does not occur.'

 He comprehends:

 'But this situation occurs
 that one who is addicted to wrong conduct in body

 It is at this stage, Ānanda,
 that it suffices to say:
 'The monk is skilled in the possible and the impossible.'"

 When this had been said the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is wonderful, revered sir,
 it is marvellous, revered sir.

 What, revered sir, is the name of this disquisition on dhamma?"

 "Wherefore do you, Ānanda,
 remember this disquisition on dhamma as
 'the Manifold Elements',
 and remember it as
 'the Fourfold Circle,[16]
 and remember it as
 'the Mirror of dhamma',
 and remember it as
 'the Drum of Deathlessness',
 and remember it as
 'the Incomparable Victory in the Battle.'"[17]

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
