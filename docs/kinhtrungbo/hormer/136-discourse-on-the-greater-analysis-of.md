# 136. Discourse on the Greater Analysis of
 Deeds[1]

## Mahā Kamma-Vibhaṅga Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.

 Now at that time the venerable Samiddhi[2]
 was staying in a little forest hut.

 Then the wanderer Potali's son,
 who was always pacing up and down,
 always roaming about on foot,
 approached the venerable Samiddhi;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Samiddhi,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the wanderer Potali's son
 spoke thus to the venerable Samiddhi:

 "Reverend Samiddhi,
 from the recluse Gotama's own mouth
 have I heard,
 from his own mouth
 have I learnt
 that deed of body is foolish,[3]
 deed of speech is foolish,
 only deed of mind is truth;[4]
 and that there is that attainment
 on attaining which
 one experiences nothing."[5]

 "Do not, friend Potali's son,
 speak thus;
 do not, friend Potali's son,
 speak thus.

 Do not misrepresent the Lord;
 for neither is misrepresentation of the Lord good
 nor would the Lord speak thus:

 'Deed of body is foolish,
 deed of speech is foolish,
 only deed of mind is truth;
 and that there is that attainment
 on attaining which
 one experiences nothing.'"

 "How long have you been gone forth, reverend Samiddhi?"
 "Not long, friend, three years."

 [255] "Now, why should we speak to monks who are Elders
 when even a newly ordained monk
 thinks that the Teacher should be defended thus?

 Reverend Samiddhi,
 when one has intentionally done a deed
 by body,
 speech
 or thought,
 what does one experience?"

 "When one has intentionally done a deed
 by body,
 speech
 or thought,
 friend Potali's son,
 one experiences anguish."

 Then the wanderer Potali's son,
 neither rejoicing in
 nor protesting against
 what the venerable Samiddhi had said,
 rose from his seat and departed
 without rejoicing,
 without protesting.

 Not long after the wanderer Potali's son had departed,
 the venerable Samiddhi approached the venerable Ānanda;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Ānanda,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Samiddhi told the venerable Ānanda
 the whole of the conversation he had had with the wanderer Potali's son
 as far as it had gone.

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Ānanda
 spoke thus to the venerable Samiddhi:

 "This, reverend Samiddhi,
 is a subject of conversation
 that should be told to the Lord.

 Wait, reverend Samiddhi,
 until we can approach the Lord;
 when we have approached the Lord
 we should tell him this matter;
 as the Lord explains it to us,
 so should we remember it."

 "Yes, your reverence,"
 the venerable Samiddhi answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.

 Then the venerable Ānanda
 and the venerable Samiddhi
 approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Ānanda
 told the Lord
 the whole of the conversation the venerable Samiddhi had had
 with the wanderer Potali's son
 as far as it had gone.

 When this had been said
 the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:
 "But I, Ānanda,
 do not even recognise the wanderer Potali's son's premise,
 how then (can I recognise) a conversation like this?

 The question of the wanderer Potali's son
 was given a one-sided answer
 by the foolish man Samiddhi
 (although) it needed a discriminating explanation."

 When this had been said
 the venerable Udāyin[6]
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "But if this, revered sir,
 were the meaning of what the [256] venerable Samiddhi said,
 (then) whatever one experiences is anguish."[7]

 Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:

 "Now, do you, Ānanda, see
 this foolish man Udāyin's (wrong) approach?[8]

 I, Ānanda, knew that this foolish man Udāyin,
 opening up (this question) now,
 would open it up to no purpose.[9]

 Ānanda, the wanderer Potali's son
 really asked about the three feelings.

 If,[10] Ānanda, this foolish man Samiddhi
 had explained thus
 when he was questioned thus
 by the wanderer Potali's son:

 'When, friend Potali's son,
 one has intentionally done a deed
 by body,
 speech
 or thought
 for experiencing pleasure
 he experiences pleasure;

 'When, friend Potali's son,
 one has intentionally done a deed
 by body,
 speech
 or thought
 for experiencing pain
 he experiences pain;

 'When, friend Potali's son,
 one has intentionally done a deed
 by body,
 speech
 or thought
 for experiencing neither pain nor pleasure
 he experiences neither pain nor pleasure;'

 explaining thus, Ānanda,
 the foolish man Samiddhi
 would have explained properly
 to the wanderer Potali's son.

 And moreover, Ānanda,
 there are foolish and inexperienced wanderers
 who are members of other sects
 who would find out about the Tathāāgata's
 great analysis of deeds[11]
 if you, Ānanda, would listen
 while the Tathāgata is classifying[12]
 the great analysis of deeds."
 "It is the time for this, Lord,
 it is the time for this, Well-farer,
 that the Lord should classify
 the great analysis of deeds.

 When the monks have heard the Lord,
 they will remember."

 "Well then, Ānanda,
 listen,
 attend carefully,
 and I will speak."

 [257] "Yes, revered sir,"
 the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "There are these four (types of) persons, Ānanda,
 existing in the world.[13]

 What four?

 Some individual here, Ānanda,
 is one who makes onslaught on creatures,
 takes what has not been given,
 wrongly enjoys pleasures of the senses,
 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in the sorrowful ways,
 a bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 ■

 But some individual here, Ānanda,
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 refrains from taking what has not been given,
 refrains from wrong enjoyment of the sense-pleasures,
 refrains from lying,
 refrains from slanderous speech,
 refrains from harsh speech,
 refrains from gossip,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind,
 and is of right view.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Some individual here, Ānanda,
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 refrains from taking what has not been given,
 refrains from wrong enjoyment of the sense-pleasures,
 refrains from lying,
 refrains from slanderous speech,
 refrains from harsh speech,
 refrains from gossip,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind,
 and is of right view.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in the sorrowful ways,
 a bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 This is a case,[14] Ānanda,
 where some recluse or brahman,
 as a result of ardour,
 as a result of striving,
 as a result of application,
 as a result of diligence,
 as a result of right mental work,[15]
 attains such concentration of mind
 that while the mind is concentrated
 he sees with the purified deva-like vision
 surpassing that of men
 some individual here
 who made onslaught on creatures,
 took what had not been given,
 wrongly enjoyed sense-pleasures,
 was a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view  and he sees that
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he has arisen in the sorrowful ways,
 a bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed there are evil deeds,
 there is [258] fruition of wrong faring.

 And the individual I saw here
 making onslaught on creatures,
 taking what had not been given,
 wrongly enjoying sense-pleasures,
 a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view  I now see
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arisen in the sorrowful way,
 a bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.'

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed everyone who makes onslaught on creatures,
 takes what has not been given,
 wrongly enjoys sense-pleasures,
 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 a bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.'

 Those who know thus
 know rightly.

 False is the knowledge
 of those that know otherwise.'
 In this way
 he obstinately holds to
 and adheres to[16]
 that which he has known by himself,
 seen by himself,
 discerned by himself as
 'This alone is the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 ■

 But there is this case, Ānanda,
 when some recluse or brahman,
 as a result of ardour,
 as a result of striving,
 as a result of application,
 as a result of diligence,
 as a result of right mental work,
 attains such concentration of mind
 that while the mind is concentrated
 he sees with the purified deva-like vision
 surpassing that of men
 some individual here
 who made onslaught on creatures,
 took what had not been given,
 wrongly enjoyed sense-pleasures,
 was a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view  and he sees that
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he has arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed there are no evil deeds,
 no fruition of wrong faring.

 And the individual I saw here
 making onslaught on creatures,
 taking what had not been given,
 wrongly enjoying sense-pleasures,
 a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view  I now see
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.'

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed everyone who makes onslaught on creatures,
 takes what has not been given,
 wrongly enjoys sense-pleasures,
 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 and of false view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying

 Those who know thus
 know rightly.

 False is the knowledge
 of those that know otherwise.'

 In this way he obstinately holds to
 and adheres to
 that which he has known,
 seen and discerned by himself as

 ■

 This is a case, Ānanda, where some recluse or brahman,
 as a result of ardour,
 as a result of striving,
 as a result of application,
 as a result of diligence,
 as a result of right mental work,
 attains such concentration of mind
 that while the mind is concentrated
 he sees with the purified deva-like vision
 surpassing that of men
 some individual here
 who was restrained from making onslaught on creatures,
 restrained from taking what had not been given,
 from wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossipping,
 who was not covetous,
 who was benevolent in mind
 and of right view,
 and sees that at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he has arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed there are lovely deeds;
 there is fruition of right faring.

 And the individual that I saw here
 who was restrained from making onslaught on creatures,
 restrained from taking what had not been given,
 from wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossipping,
 who was not covetous,
 who was benevolent in mind
 and of right view,
 I now see at [259] the breaking up of the body after dying
 arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.'

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed everyone who is restrained from making onslaught on creatures,
 restrained from taking what had not been given,
 from wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossipping,
 who was not covetous,
 who was benevolent in mind
 and of right view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Those who know thus
 know rightly.

 False is the knowledge
 of those that know otherwise.'

 In this way he obstinately holds to
 and adheres to
 that which he has known,

 But there is this case, Ānanda,
 when some recluse or brahman,
 as a result of ardour,
 as a result of striving,
 as a result of application,
 as a result of diligence,
 as a result of right mental work,
 attains such concentration of mind
 that while the mind is concentrated

 He speaks thus:

 'Indeed everyone who is restrained from making onslaught on creatures,

 Those who know thus

 False is the knowledge
 of those that know otherwise.'

 In this way he obstinately holds to
 and adheres to
 that which he has known,
 seen and discerned by himself as
 'This alone is the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'
 As to this, Ānanda,
 whatever recluse or brahman speaks thus:

 'Indeed there are evil deeds,
 there is fruition of wrong faring'
 this I allow to him.

 And if he speaks thus:

 'The individual that I saw here,

 a gossip,
 covetous,

 And if he speaks thus:

 What is the cause of this?

 The [260] Tathāāgata's knowledge
 of the great analysis of deeds
 is otherwise, Ānanda.

 As to this, Ānanda,

 As to this, Ānanda, whatever individual there is who makes onslaught on creatures,

 malevolent in mind,

 As to this, Ānanda, whatever individual there is who is restrained [262] from making onslaught on creatures,
 is restrained from taking what has not been given,
 from wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossipping,
 who was not covetous,

 And he who was restrained from making onslaught on creatures here,

 As to this, Ānanda, whatever individual there is
 who is restrained from making onslaught on creatures,
 is restrained from taking what has not been given,
 from wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures,

 gossipping,

 Niraya Hell.

 And he who was restrained from making onslaught on creatures here,
 is restrained from taking what has not been given,

 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossipping,
 who is not covetous,
 who is benevolent in mind
 and of right view
 undergoes its fruition
 which arises either here and now
 or in another mode.

 So, Ānanda,
 there is the deed that is inoperative,[18]
 apparently inoperative;[19]
 there is the deed that is inoperative,
 apparently operative;
 there is the deed that is both operative
 and apparently operative;
 there is the deed that is operative,
 apparently inoperative."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
