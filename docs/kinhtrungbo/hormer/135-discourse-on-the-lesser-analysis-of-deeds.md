# 135. Discourse on the Lesser Analysis of Deeds

## Cūḷa Kamma-Vibhaṅga Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,[2] approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
 the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Now, good Gotama, what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that [249] lowness and excellence
 are to be seen among human beings
 while they are in human form?[3]

 For, good Gotama,
 human beings of short life-span are to be seen
 and those of long life-span;
 those of many
 and those of few illnesses;
 those who are ugly,
 those who are beautiful;
 those who are of little account,
 those of great account;
 those who are poor,
 those who are wealthy;
 those who are of lowly families,
 those of high families;[4]
 those who are weak in wisdom,
 those who are full of wisdom.

 Now what, good Gotama, is the cause,
 what the reason
 that lowness and excellence
 are to be seen among human beings
 while they are in human form?"

 "Deeds[5] are one's own, brahman youth,
 beings are heirs to deeds,[6]
 deeds are matrix,
 deeds are kin,
 deeds are arbiters.[7]

 Deed divides beings,
 that is to say
 by lowness and excellence."
 "I do not understand the meaning in full
 of that which was spoken by the good Gotama in brief
 and the meaning of which was not explained in full.

 It were well if the good Gotama
 were so to teach me dhamma
 that I should understand the meaning in full
 of that which was spoken by the good Gotama in brief
 but the meaning of which was not explained in full."

 "Well then, brahman youth,
 listen,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, sir,"
 the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,
 answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is one that makes onslaught on creatures,
 is cruel,
 bloody-handed,
 intent on injuring and killing,
 and without mercy to living creatures.[8]

 Because of that [250] deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held[9] thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.
 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is of a short life-span.

 This course is conducive
 to shortness of life-span, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 making onslaught on creatures,
 being cruel,
 bloody-handed,
 intent on injuring and killing,
 and without mercy to living creatures.

 ■

 But, brahman youth,
 here some woman or man,
 by getting rid of onslaught on creatures
 is one who abstains from onslaught on creatures;
 the stick laid aside,
 the sword laid aside,
 he lives scrupulous,
 merciful,
 kindly and compassionate to all living creatures.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is of a long life-span.

 This course is conducive
 to length of life-span, brahman youth,
 that is to say,
 if one, by getting rid of onslaught on creatures,
 abstains from onslaught on creatures,
 (and with) the stick laid aside,
 the sword laid aside,
 lives scrupulous,
 merciful,
 kindly and compassionate to all living creatures.

 ■

 Brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is by nature harmful to creatures
 with his hand
 or with a clod of earth
 or with a stick
 or with a sword.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he has many illnesses.

 This course is conducive
 to many illnesses, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 being by nature harmful to creatures
 with his hand
 or with a clod of earth
 or with a stick
 or with a sword.

 ■

 But, brahman youth,
 here some woman or man
 is not by nature harmful to creatures
 with his hand
 or with a clod of earth
 or with a stick
 or with a sword.

 Because of that deed
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he has few illnesses.

 This [251] course is conducive
 to few illnesses, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 not being by nature harmful to creatures
 with his hand
 or with a clod of earth
 or with a stick
 or with a sword.

 ■

 Brahman youth, here some woman or man is wrathful;
 turbulent on being spoken to
 even about a trifle,
 he takes offence,
 gets angry,
 disagrees,
 resists,
 and evinces anger,
 hatred
 and resentment.[10]

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is ugly.

 This course is conducive to ugliness, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 being wrathful;
 turbulent on being spoken to
 even about a trifle,
 taking offence,
 getting angry,
 disagreeing,
 resisting,
 evincing anger,
 hatred
 and resentment.

 ■

 But, brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is not wrathful;
 not turbulent on being spoken to
 even about a large matter,
 he takes no offence,
 does not get angry,
 does not disagree,
 resist
 or evince anger,
 hatred
 and resentment.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is lovely.[11]

 This course is conducive to loveliness, brahman youth,
 that is to say not being wrathful;
 not being turbulent on being spoken to
 even about a large matter,
 he taking no offence,
 not getting angry,
 not disagreeing,
 resisting
 or evincing anger,
 hatred
 and resentment.

 ■
 Brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is jealous-minded;
 he is jealous,
 revengeful[12]
 and harbours jealousy
 on account of others' gains,
 honour,
 fame
 and the marks of respect and reverence
 paid to them.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is of little account.

 This course is conducive
 to being of little account, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 being jealous-minded;
 jealous,
 revengeful
 harbouring jealousy
 on account of others' gains,
 honour,
 fame
 and the marks of respect and reverence
 paid to them.

 ■

 But, brahman youth,
 here some woman or man
 is not jealous-minded;
 he is not jealous
 or revengeful
 nor does he harbour jealousy
 on account of others' gains,
 honour,
 fame
 and the marks of respect and reverence
 paid to them.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is of great account.
 This course is conducive
 to being of great account, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 not being jealous-minded;
 not being jealous
 or revengeful
 nor harbouring jealousy
 on account of others' gains,
 honour,
 fame
 and the marks of respect and reverence
 paid to them.

 ■

 Brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is not a giver[13] to recluse or brahman
 of drink,
 food,
 clothing,
 vehicle,
 garlands,
 scents,
 unguents,
 bed,
 lodging,
 light.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.
 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is poor.

 This course is conducive to poverty, [252] brahman youth,
 that is to say not being a giver to recluse or brahman
 of drink,
 food,
 clothing,
 vehicle,
 garlands,
 scents,
 unguents,
 bed,
 lodging,
 light.

 ■

 But, brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is a giver to recluse or brahman
 of drink,
 food,

 unguents,
 bed,
 lodging,
 light.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is wealthy.

 This course is conducive to wealth, brahman youth,
 that is to say being a giver to recluse or brahman
 of drink,
 food,
 clothing,
 vehicle,
 garlands,
 scents,
 unguents,
 bed,
 lodging,
 light.

 ■

 Brahman youth, here some woman or man
 is callous
 and proud;
 he does not greet one
 who should be greeted,
 does not stand up for one
 who should be stood up for,
 he does not give a seat to one
 meriting a seat,
 he does not make room[14]
 for one meriting room,
 he does not respect,

 honoured.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is of a lowly family.
 This course is conducive
 to being in a lowly family, brahman youth,
 that is to say being one who is callous
 and proud;
 he does not greet one
 who should be greeted,
 does not stand up for one
 who should be stood up for,
 he does not give a seat to one
 meriting a seat,
 he does not make room
 for one meriting room,
 he does not respect,

 ■

 But, brahman youth, here some woman or man

 stands up for one
 who should be stood up for,
 he gives a seat to one
 meriting a seat,
 he makes room
 for one meriting room,
 he respects,
 reveres,

 honoured.

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 it is in a high family.

 This course is conducive
 to being in a high family, brahman youth,
 that is to say being one who is not callous
 or proud;
 one who greets one who should be greeted,
 stands up for one
 who should be stood up for,
 one who gives a seat to one
 meriting a seat,
 one who makes room
 for one meriting room,
 one who respects,
 reveres,
 reverences,
 honours one who should be
 revered,
 reverenced,
 honoured.

 ■

 Brahman youth, here some woman or a man,
 having approached a recluse or a brahman,
 is not one that asks:

 'What, revered sir, is skill?

 What is unskill?

 What is blameable?

 What un-blameable?

 What should be practised?

 What not practised?

 What, being done by me, is for long for my woe and anguish?

 Or what, being done by me, is for long for my welfare and happiness?

 Because of this deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 he, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 is weak in wisdom.

 This course is conducive
 to being weak in wisdom, brahman youth,
 that is to say
 having approached a recluse or a brahman,
 being one that that does not ask:

 'What, revered sir, is skill?

 What is unskill?

 What is blameable?

 What un-blameable?

 What should be practised?

 What not practised?

 What, being done by me, is for long for my woe and anguish?

 Or what, being done by me, is for long for my welfare and happiness?

 ■

 But, brahman youth, here some woman or man,
 having approached a recluse or brahman, is one that asks:

 'What, revered sir, is skill?

 What is unskill?

 What is blameable?
 What un-blameable?

 What should be practised?

 What not practised?

 What, being done by me, is for long for my woe and anguish?

 Or what, being done by me, is for long for my welfare and happiness?

 Because of that deed,
 accomplished thus,
 firmly held thus,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 But if, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he does not arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world,
 but comes to human status,
 then wherever he is born
 (in a new existence)
 he is of great wisdom.

 This course is conducive to great wisdom, [253] brahman youth, that is to say,
 having approached a recluse or brahman, being one that asks:

 'What, revered sir, is skill?

 What is unskill?

 What is blameable?

 What un-blameable?

 What should be practised?
 What not practised?

 What, being done by me, is for long for my woe and anguish?

 Or what, being done by me, is for long for my welfare and happiness?

 So, brahman youth,
 the course conducive to a short life-span
 leads to shortness of life-span;
 the course conducive to a long lifespan
 leads to length of life-span;
 the course conducive to many illnesses
 leads to having many illnesses;
 the course conducive to few illnesses
 leads to having few illnesses;
 the course conducive to being ugly
 leads to ugliness;
 the course conducive to being lovely
 leads to loveliness;
 the course conducive to being of small account
 leads to smallness of account;
 the course conducive to being of great account
 leads to greatness of account;
 the course conducive to being poor,
 leads to poverty;
 the course conducive to being wealthy
 leads to wealth;
 the course conducive to being of lowly family
 leads to being in a lowly family;
 the course conducive to being of high family
 leads to being in a high family;
 the course conducive to being weak in wisdom
 leads to weakness of wisdom;
 the course conducive to being of great wisdom
 leads to greatness in wisdom.
 Deeds are one's own, brahman youth,
 beings are heirs to deeds,
 deeds are the matrix,
 deeds the kin,
 deeds the arbiters.

 Deed divides beings,
 that is to say
 by lowness and excellence."

 When this had been said,
 the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is excellent, good Gotama,
 excellent, good Gotama.

 It is as if, good Gotama,
 one might set upright what had been upset,
 or might disclose what was covered,
 or point out the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so is dhamma made clear
 in many a figure by the good Gotama.

 I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the revered Gotama accept me
 as a lay-follower,
 one gone for refuge from today forth
 for as long as life lasts."
