# 148. Discourse on the Six Sixes

## Cha-Chakka Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I will teach you dhamma, monks,
 lovely in the beginning,
 lovely in the middle,
 lovely at the ending.
 With the spirit and the letter
 I will proclaim to you the Brahma-faring,
 utterly complete,
 quite purified,
 that is to say the Six Sixes.

 Listen to it,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Six internal sense-fields are to be understood,
 six external sense-fields are to be understood,
 six classes of consciousness are to be understood,
 six classes of sensory impingement are to be understood,
 six classes of feeling are to be understood,
 six classes of craving are to be understood.

 When it is said,
 'Six internal sense-fields are to be understood'
 in reference to what is it said?

 It is in reference to the sense-field of eye,
 the sense-field of ear,
 the sense-field of nose,
 the sense-field of tongue,
 the sense-field of body,
 the sense-field of mind.
 When it is said,
 'Six internal sense-fields are to be understood'
 it is said in reference to this.

 This is the first Six.

 When it is said,
 'Six external sense-fields are to be understood,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 It is in reference to the sense-field of material shapes,
 the sense-field of sounds,
 the sense-field of smells,
 the sense-field of tastes,
 the sense-field of touches,
 the sense-field of mental states.

 When it is said,
 'Six external sense-fields are to be understood,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 This is the second Six.

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of consciousness are to be understood,'
 in reference to what is it said?
 It is in reference to
 the visual consciousness that arises
 because of eye and material shapes;

 the auditory consciousness that arises
 because of ear and sounds;

 the [332] olfactory consciousness that arises
 because of nose and smells;

 the gustatory consciousness that arises
 because of tongue and tastes;

 the bodily consciousness that arises
 because of body and touches;

 the mental consciousness that arises
 because of mind and mental states.

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of consciousness are to be understood,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 This is the third Six.

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of (sense-)impingement are to be understood,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 It is in reference to
 the visual consciousness that arises
 because of eye and material shapes the meeting of the three
 is sensory impingement;[1]

 the auditory consciousness that arises
 because of ear and sounds  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;

 the olfactory consciousness that arises
 because of nose and smells  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;

 the gustatory consciousness that arises
 because of tongue and tastes  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;

 the bodily consciousness that arises
 because of body and touches  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;

 the mental consciousness that arises
 because of mind and mental states  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement.

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of sensory impingement are to be understood,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 This is the fourth Six.

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of feeling are to be understood,'
 in reference to what is it said?
 It is in reference to
 the visual consciousness that arises
 because of eye and material shapes  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling;

 the auditory consciousness that arises
 because of ear and sounds  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling;

 the mental consciousness that arises
 because of mind and mental states  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling;

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of feeling are to be understood,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 This is the fifth Six.
 When it is said,
 'Six classes of craving are to be understood,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 It is in reference to
 the visual consciousness that arises
 because of eye and material shapes  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement,
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling,
 conditioned by feeling is craving;

 the [333] auditory consciousness that arises
 because of ear and sounds  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement,
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling,
 conditioned by feeling is craving;

 the olfactory consciousness that arises
 because of nose and smells  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement,
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling,
 conditioned by feeling is craving;

 the gustatory consciousness that arises
 because of tongue and tastes  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement,
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling,
 conditioned by feeling is craving;

 the bodily consciousness that arises
 because of body and touches  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement,
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling,
 conditioned by feeling is craving;

 the mental consciousness that arises
 because of mind and mental states  the meeting of the three is sensory impingement,
 conditioned by sensory impingement is feeling,
 conditioned by feeling is craving.

 When it is said,
 'Six classes of craving are to be understood,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 This is the sixth Six.

 Monks, visual consciousness arises
 because of eye and material shapes,
 the meeting of the three is sensory impingement;
 an experience arises
 conditioned by sensory impingement
 that is pleasant
 or painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant.

 He, being impinged on
 by a pleasant feeling,
 delights,
 rejoices
 and persists in cleaving to it;
 a tendency to attachment is latent in him.[4]

 Being impinged on
 by a painful feeling,
 he grieves,
 mourns,
 laments,
 beats his breast
 and falls into disillusion;

 §

 Seeing thus, monks,
 the instructed disciple of the ariyans
 turns away from the eye,
 he turns away from material shapes,
 he turns away from visual consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the eye;
 he turns away from feeling,
 he turns away from craving.

 ■

 He turns away from the ear,
 he turns away from sounds;
 he turns away from auditory consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the ear;
 he turns away from feeling,
 he turns away from craving.

 ■

 He turns away from the nose,
 he turns away from smells;
 he turns away from olfactory consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the nose;
 he turns away from feeling,
 he turns away from craving.

 ■

 He turns away from the tongue,
 he turns away from tastes;
 he turns away from gustatory consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the tongue;
 he turns away from feeling,
 he turns away from craving.

 ■

 He turns away from the body,
 he turns away from touches;
 he turns away from tactile consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the body;
 he turns away from feeling,
 he turns away from craving.

 ■

 He turns away from the mind,
 he turns away from mental states,
 he turns away from mental consciousness,
 he turns away from impact on the mind;
 he turns away from feeling,
 he turns away from craving.

 §

 In turning away he is dispassionate;
 by dispassion he is freed;
 in freedom is the knowledge that he is freed,
 and he comprehends:

 Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so."

 [336] Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.

 And while this exposition was being given
 the minds of as many as sixty monks
 were freed from the cankers without grasping.[5]
