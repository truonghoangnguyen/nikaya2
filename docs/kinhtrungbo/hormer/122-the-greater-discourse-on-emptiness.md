# 122. The Greater Discourse on Emptiness

## Mahā Suññata Sutta

#### [152]

 THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's park.[1]

 Then the Lord, having dressed early in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe
 entered Kapilavatthu for almsfood.
 When he had walked in Kapilavatthu for almsfood
 and was returning from the alms gathering
 after the meal,
 he approached the dwelling-place of the Sakyan Kāḷakhe- [153] maka[2] for the day-sojourn.

 Now at that time many lodgings[3] were prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan.
 The Lord saw these many [110] lodgings prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan,
 and when the Lord had seen them it occurred to him:

 "Many lodgings are prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan.
 Are many monks staying here?"

 Now at that time the venerable Ānanda
 together with many monks
 was making up robe-material in the dwelling-place of Ghaṭāya the Sakyan.[4]

 Then the Lord, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,
 approached the dwelling-place of Ghaṭāya the Sakyan;
 having approached, he sat down on a seat that was ready.
 While he was sitting down the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:

 "Many lodgings, Ānanda, are prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan.
 Are many monks staying there?"

 "Many lodgings, revered sir, are prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan;
 many monks are staying there.
 It is our time, revered sir, for making up robe-material."

 "Ānanda, a monk does not shine[5] who delights in his own group,[6]
 is delighted by his own group,
 is intent on delight in his own group,[7]
 who delights in some other group,
 is delighted by some other group,
 is rejoiced by some other group.

 Indeed, Ānanda, the situation does not exist when a monk,
 delighting in his own group,
 delighted by his own group,
 intent on delight in his own group,
 delighting in some other group,
 delighted by some other group,
 rejoicing in some other group,
 can be one who acquires at will,
 without trouble, without difficulty,
 that which is the happiness of renunciation,[8]
 the happiness of aloofness,[9] the happiness of calm,[10]
 the happiness of self-awakening.[11]

 But, Ānanda, the situation exists

 [154] when it is expected of a monk who dwells alone,
 remote from a group,
 that he will be one who acquires at will,
 without trouble, without difficulty,
 that which is the happiness of renunciation,
 the happiness of aloofness,
 the happiness of calm,
 the happiness of self-awakening.

 Indeed, Ānanda, the situation does not exist when a monk,
 delighting in his own group,
 delighted by his own group,
 intent on delight in his own group,
 delighting in some other group,
 delighted by some other group,
 rejoicing in some other group,
 entering on the freedom of mind that is temporal and pleasing[12]
 or on that which is not temporal and is unshakable,
