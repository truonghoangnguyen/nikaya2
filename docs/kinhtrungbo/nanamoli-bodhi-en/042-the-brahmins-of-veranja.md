# 42 The Brahmins of Verañja
***(Verañjaka Sutta)***

1\. Thus have 1 heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣ika's Park.

2\. Now on that occasion some brahmin householders of Verañja were on a visit to Sāvatthī for some business or other. [291]

3-44. [The text of this sutta is the same as that of Sutta 41, except that where the preceding sutta is phrased in terms of "conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct" ( $\§87$-10) and "conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct" ( $\§811-14$ ), this sutta is phrased in terms of "one who does not observe conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, one of unrighteous conduct" and "one who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, one of righteous conduct"; substitute "Verañja" for "Sālā" throughout.]
