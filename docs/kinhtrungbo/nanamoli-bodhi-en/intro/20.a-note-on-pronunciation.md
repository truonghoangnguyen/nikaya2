# A NOTE ON PRONUNCIATION

The pronunciation of Pali words and names is quite easy providing the following simple rules are heeded. Among the vowels:

| a | i | u | as in "but," "pin," "duke"; |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ā | ī | ū | as in "father," "keen," "pool"; |
| e | and | o | as in "way" and "home." |

Among the consonants, g is pronounced as in "girl," _c_ as in "church," ñ as in "canyon." The cerebrals -_t, d, n, l_ - are spoken with the tongue on the roof of the mouth; the dentals - _ṭ, ḍ, ṇ, ḷ_- with the tongue on the upper teeth. _m_ is a nasal as in "sing." The aspirates -_k h, g h, c h, j h, t h, d h, t h, d h, p h_, and _b h_ - are single consonants pronounced with a slight outward puff of breath, e.g., th as in "Thomas" (not as in "that"), ph as in "top hat" (not as in "phone"). Double consonants are always enunciated separately, e.g., _d d_ as in "mad dog," _g g_ as in "big gun."

An _o_ and an _e_ always carry a stress, otherwise the stress falls on a long vowel -ā, ī, or ū - or on a double consonant, or on ṃ.

This list shows the most important of the changes in Ven. Nānamoli's manuscript terminology that were made for this edition. Changes marked with an asterisk were already introduced by Ven. Khantipālo in A Treasury of the Buddha's Words.
