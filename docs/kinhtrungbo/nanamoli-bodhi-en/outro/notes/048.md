SUTTA 48

###### [^491]
The background to this sutta is the quarrel at Kosambī, which is related at Vin Mv Kh 10 (Vin i. 337 ff.) and in Nāṇamoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp. 109-19. The quarrel, which began with a casual misunderstanding of a minor disciplinary rule, quickly flared up and divided a large part of the Sangha and laity resident at Kosambī into two hostile factions.

Dhammatā.

This is a breach of the code of monastic discipline from which a bhikkhu can be rehabilitated either by a formal act of the Sangha or by confession to another bhikkhu. Even though a noble disciple may commit such an offence unintentionally or through lack of knowledge, he makes no attempt to conceal it but immediately discloses it and seeks the means of rehabilitation.

###### [^496]
Balatā.

###### [^497]
See n. 91.

###### [^498]
MA calls those seven factors the "great reviewing knowledges" (mahāpaccavekkhaṇañāna) of a stream-enterer. On the reviewing knowledges see Vsm XXII, 19-21.
