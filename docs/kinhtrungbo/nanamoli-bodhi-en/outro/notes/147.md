SUTTA 147

###### [^1323]
MA says that this discourse was spoken to Rāhula shortly after his higher ordination, presumably at the age of twenty.

###### [^1324]
Vimuttiparipācanīya dhammā. MA mentions fifteen states that ripen in deliverance: the five spiritual faculties; the five penetrative insights - into impermanence, suffering, non-self, abandoning, and fading away; and the five things taught to Meghiya - noble friendship, virtue, beneficial discussion, energy, and wisdom (see AN 9:3/ iv.356; Ud 4:1/36).

###### [^1325]
MA says that these deities, who came from various celestial realms, had been companions of Rāhula's during the previous life in which he first made the aspiration to attain arahantship as the son of a Buddha.

###### [^1326]
It should be noted that the last four items mentioned are the four mental aggregates. Thus this discourse covers not only the sense bases but also the five aggregates, the aggregate of material form being implied by the physical sense faculties and their objects.

###### [^1327]
According to MA, stream-entry was the minimal attainment of those deities, but some attained the higher paths and fruits up to arahantship.
