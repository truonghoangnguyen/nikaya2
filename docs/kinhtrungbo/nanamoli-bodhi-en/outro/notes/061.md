SUTTA 61

###### [^637]
Rāhula was the only son of the Buddha, born on the day his father left the palace to seek enlightenment. At the age of seven he was ordained as a novice by Ven. Sāriputta on the occasion of the Buddha's first return visit to Kapilavatthu after his enlightenment. The Buddha declared him the foremost disciple among those desirous of training. According to MA, this discourse was taught to Rāhula when he was seven years old, thus very shortly after his ordination. At MN 147 he attains arahantship after listening to a discourse by the Buddha on the development of insight.

###### [^638]
To acknowledge a wrong deed as such, confess it, and undertake restraint for the future leads to growth in the discipline of the Noble One. See MN 65.13.

###### [^639]
In this section, however, the phrase "then you should confess such a bodily action...and laid it open" is replaced by the following: "Then you should be repelled, ashamed, and disgusted by that mental action. Having become repelled, ashamed, and disgusted by that mental action..." This substitution is made because unwholesome thoughts, unlike bodily and verbal transgressions, do not require confession as a means of exmeration. Both Horner in MLS and $\bar{N} m$ in Ms missed this variation.
