SUTTA 40

###### [^422]
Where the previous sutta used the phrase "things that
make one a recluse" (dhammā samanakaraña), the present sutta speaks of "the way proper to the recluse" (samanasamīcipatipada).

###### [^423]
The first ten of these twelve "stains for a recluse" are included among the sixteen "imperfections that defile the mind" at MN 7.3.

###### [^424]
MA: Because he has quieted down (samita) all defilements, he is a recluse in the highest sense (paramatthasamana).
