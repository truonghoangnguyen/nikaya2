SUTTA 58

###### [^611]
Prince Abhaya was a son of King Bimbisāra of Magadha, though not the heir to the throne.

###### [^612]
Both horns of the dilemma devised by the Niganṭha Nātaputta presupposed that the Buddha would give a one-sided answer. Now that a one-sided answer has been rejected, the dilemma becomes inapplicable.

###### [^613]
The Buddha does not hesitate to rebuke and admonish his disciples when he sees that such speech will promote their welfare.

###### [^614]
MA says that dhammadhātu ("element of things") refers to the Buddha's knowledge of omniscience. Dhammadhātu here should not be confused with the same term used to signify the element of mind-objects among the eighteen elements, nor does it bear the meaning of an all-embracing cosmic principle that the term acquires in Mahāyāna Buddhism.
