SUTTA 139

###### [^1257]
This is substantially identical with the proclamation with which the newly enlightened Buddha opened his first discourse to the five bhikkhus, before teaching them the Four Noble Truths.

###### [^1258]
This is a more complicated expression for the pursuit of sensual pleasure.

###### [^1259]
MA: It is "beset by suffering, vexation," etc., through the
suffering and vexation, etc., of its results and the suffering and vexation, etc., of its attendant defilements.

###### [^1260]
This is craving for being.

###### [^1261]
That is, extolling and disparaging come about when one frames one's statements in terms of persons, some of whom are praised and others blamed. One teaches "only the Dhamma" when one frames one's statements in terms of the state (dhamma) - the mode of practice - without explicit references to persons.

###### [^1262]
This problem of "insistence on local language" must have been particularly acute in the Sangha, when the bhikkhus lived a life of constant wandering and had to pass through many localities each with their distinct dialects.

###### [^1263]
Ven. Subhūti was the younger brother of Anāthapiṇ̣ika and became a bhikkhu on the day Jeta's Grove was offered to the Sangha. The Buddha appointed him the foremost disciple in two categories - those who live without conflict and those who are worthy of gifts.
