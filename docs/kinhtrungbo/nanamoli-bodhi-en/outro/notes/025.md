SUTTA 25

###### [^293]
Cetovimutti: MA explains that they simply abandoned their resolution to live in the wilds, though it could well be that these ascetics had attained - and lost - the eight meditative attainments that are usually implied by the term cetovimutti.

###### [^294]
These are the ten speculative views debated by the ascetic philosophers of the Buddha's age. All were rejected by the Buddha as being unconnected with the fundamentals of the holy life and unconducive to liberation from suffering. See MN 63, MN 72.

###### [^295]
The eight meditative attainments here must be understood, as MA explains, as bases for insight. When a bhikkhu has entered such a jh훮na, M훮ra cannot see how
his mind is proceeding. This immunity from M훮ra's influence, however, is as yet only temporary.

###### [^296]
This last bhikkhu, by destroying the taints, has become not only temporarily invisible to M훮ra but permanently inaccessible to him. On the cessation of perception and feeling, see Introduction, p. 41.
