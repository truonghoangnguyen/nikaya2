SUTTA 143

###### [^1305]
MA says that clinging to the eye takes place by way of desire and lust; consciousness is dependent on the eye by way of craving and views. However, since Anāthapiṇ̣ika was already a stream-enterer, dependence for him would have involved only craving, views having been eradicated by the path of stream-entry.

###### [^1306]
This statement does not imply that there is any inherent exclusiveness or arbitrary discrimination in the Buddha's way of presenting his teaching. But as those who remain in lay life must look after their families, possessions, and occupations, such talk leading to complete detachment would not have been appropriate for them.
