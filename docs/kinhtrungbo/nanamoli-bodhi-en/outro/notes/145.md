SUTTA 145

###### [^1315]
This Punna is a different person from Punna Mantāniputta of MN 24. He was from a family of merchants residing in the port city of Suppāraka in the Sunāparanta
country (present-day Maharashtra). On a business trip to Sāvatthi he heard the Buddha give a discourse and renounced the home life to become a bhikkhu.

MA explains this instruction as a short teaching on the Four Noble Truths. Delight (nandt) is an aspect of craving. Through the arising of delight in regard to the eye and forms there arises the suffering of the five aggregates. Thus in this first part of the instruction the Buddha teaches the round of existence by way of the first two truths - suffering and its origin - as they occur through the six senses. In the second part ( §4 ) he teaches the ending of the round by way of the second two truths - cessation and the path - expressed as the abandoning of delight in the six senses and their objects.

###### [^1317]
That is, he expired. Since the Buddha still refers to Punna as a clansman (kulaputta), he must have died within a short time after returning to the Sunāparanta country. The texts leave no record of how he died.
