SUTTA 73

###### [^724]
This question and the next refer to arahantship, which (according to MA) Vacchagotta thought may have been an exclusive prerogative of the Buddha.

###### [^725]
This question refers to the non-returner. Even though the non-returner may remain in the lay life, he necessarily observes celibacy because he has cut off the fetter of sensual desire.

###### [^726]
This question refers to the stream-enterer and the oncereturner, who may still indulge in sensual pleasures if they remain in the lay life.

###### [^727]
MA: He had attained the fruit of the non-returner and came to ask the Buddha about the practice of insight for attaining the path of arahantship. However, the Buddha saw that he had the supporting conditions for the six direct knowledges. Thus he taught him serenity for producing the five mundane direct knowledges and insight for reaching arahantship.

###### [^728]
The suitable basis (ayatana) is the fourth jhāna for the five direct knowledges and insight for arahantship.

###### [^729]
Paricinno me Bhagavā, paricinno me Sugato. This is an indirect way of informing the Buddha of his attainment of arahantship. The bhikkhus did not understand this, and therefore the Buddha interprets its significance for them.
