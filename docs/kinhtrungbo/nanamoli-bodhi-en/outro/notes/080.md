SUTTA 80

###### [^787]
MA identifies Vekhanassa as Sakuludāyin's teacher.

###### [^788]
MA: Even though he was a wanderer, he was keenly intent on sensual pleasures. The Buddha undertook this teaching in order to make him recognise his strong concern with sensual pleasures, and thus the discourse would be beneficial to him.

###### [^789]
In the Pali this sentence takes the form of a riddle, and the translation here is conjectural. MA explains that the "pleasure higher than the sensual" (or "the highest sensual pleasure," kämaggasukham்) is Nibbāna.
