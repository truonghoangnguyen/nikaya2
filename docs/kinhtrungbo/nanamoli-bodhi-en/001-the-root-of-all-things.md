# 1. The Root of All Things

[1] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.[1] On one occasion the
Blessed One was living in Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga Grove at
the root of a royal sāla tree. There he addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus.”[2] — “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed
One said this:

2. “Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the root of
all things.[3] Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” —
“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One
said this:

has understood that delight is the root of suffering, and that with
being [as condition] there is birth, and that for whatever has
come to be there is ageing and death.[29] Therefore, bhikkhus,
through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation,
giving up, and relinquishing of cravings, the Tathāgata has
awakened to supreme full enlightenment, I say.[30]

That is what the Blessed One said. But those bhikkhus
did not delight in the Blessed One’s words.[31]

--Annotation

1 For a fuller treatment of this important and difficult sutta, see Bhikkhu Bodhi,
Discourse on the Root of Existence. This work contains, besides a translation of
the sutta, a lengthy analytical study of its philosophical significance and copious
extracts from the very helpful commentarial literature that has accumulated
around it. Ñm’s render- ing of this sutta in Ms was highly conjectural; thus, while
I have retained most of his terminology, I have substi- tuted my own rendering of
the syntax to bring out the meaning that accords with the traditional interpretation
and that seems warranted by the original Pali text as well. The key passages as
Ñm rendered them will be given in the Notes.

2 MA explains that the Buddha delivered this sutta to dispel the conceit that had
arisen in five hundred bhikkhus on account of their erudition and intellectual
mastery of the Buddha’s teachings. These bhikkhus were formerly brah- mins
learned in the Vedic literature, and the Buddha’s cryptic utterances may well
have been intended to chal- lenge the brahmanic views to which they may still
have adhered.

3 Sabbadhammamūlapariyāya. MṬ explains that the word “all” (sabba) is being
used here in the restricted sense  of the “all of personal identity” (sakkāyasabba),
that is, with reference to all states or phenomena (dhammā) com- prised within
the five aggregates affected by clinging (see MN 28.4). Supramundane states—
the paths, fruits, and Nibbāna—are excluded. The “root of all things”—that is,
the special condition that maintains the continuity of the process of repeated
existence—MṬ explains to be craving, conceit, and views (which are the
underlying springs of “conceiving”), and these in turn are underlaid by ignorance, suggested in the sutta by the phrase “he has not fully understood it.”


4 The “untaught ordinary person” (assutavā puthujjana) is the common worldling,
who possesses neither learning nor spiritual accomplishment in the Dhamma
of the noble ones, and allows himself to be dominated by the multitude of
defilements and wrong views. See Bodhi, Discourse on the Root of Existence,
pp. 40–46.

5 Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito sañjānāti. Although perceiving “earth as earth” seems to
suggest seeing the object as it really is, the aim of Buddhist insight meditation,
the context makes it clear that the ordinary person’s perception of “earth as
earth” already introduces a slight distortion of the object, a distortion that will be
blown up into full-fledged misin- terpretation when the cognitive process enters
the phase of “conceiving.” MA explains that the ordinary person seizes upon the
conventional expression “it is earth,” and applying this to the object, perceives it
through a “perver- sion of perception” (saññāvipallāsa). The latter is a techni- cal
expression explained as perceiving the impermanent as permanent, the painful
as pleasurable, what is not self as self, and what is foul as beautiful (AN 4:49/
ii.52). Ñm reads the ablative suffix -to of the Pali as signifying der- ivation and
translates the phrase: “From earth he has a percept of earth.”

6 The Pali verb “conceives” (maññati), from the root man, “to think,” is often used
in the Pali suttas to mean dis- tortional thinking—thought that ascribes to its
object characteristics and a significance derived not from the object itself, but
from one’s own subjective imaginings. The cognitive distortion introduced by
conceiving con- sists, in brief, in the intrusion of the egocentric perspec- tive into
the experience already slightly distorted by spontaneous perception. According
to the commentaries, the activity of conceiving is governed by three defile ments,
which account for the different ways it comes  to manifestation—craving (taṇhā),
conceit (māna), and views (diṭṭhi).


The four ways of conceiving (maññanā): The Buddha shows that the conceiving
of any object may occur in any of four ways, expressed by the text as a fourfold
linguistic pattern: accusative, locative, ablative, and appropriative. The primary
significance of this modal pattern—enigmatic in the Pali as well—seems
to be ontological. I take the pat- tern to represent the diverse ways in which
the ordinary person attempts to give positive being to his imagined sense of
egohood by positing, below the threshold of reflection, a relationship between
himself as the subject of cognition and the perceived phenomenon as its object.
According to the fourfold pattern given, this relationship may be one either of
direct identification (“he conceives X”), or of inherence (“he conceives in X”), or
of contrast or derivation (“he conceives from X”), or of simple appro- priation (“he
conceives X to be ‘mine’”).
But care is needed in interpreting these phrases. The Pali does not supply any
direct object for the second and third modes, and this suggests that the process
at work  in conceiving proceeds from a deeper and more general level than that
involved in the forming of an explicit view of self, as described for example at
MN 2.8 or MN 44.7. The activity of conceiving thus seems to comprise the entire
range of subjectively tinged cognition, from the impulses and thoughts in which
the sense of personal identity is still inchoate to elaborate intellectual structures
in which it has been fully explicated.
Ñm, however, understands the implicit object of con- ceiving to be the percept
itself, and accordingly translates: “having had from earth a percept of earth, he
conceives [that to be] earth, he conceives [that to be] in earth, he con- ceives
[that to be apart] from earth,” etc.
The fifth phrase, “he delights in X,” explicitly con- nects conceiving with craving,
which is elsewhere said  to “delight here and there.” This, moreover, hints at the
danger in the worldling’s thought processes, since crav- ing is pointed to by the
Buddha as the origin of suffering.
MA gives prolific examples illustrating all the different modes of conceiving, and
these clearly establish that the intended object of conceiving is the misplaced
sense of egoity.

7 MA states that one who fully understands earth does so by the three types of full
understanding: the full under- standing of the known (ñātapariññā)—the definition
of the earth element by way of its unique characteristic, function, manifestation,
and proximate cause; the full understand- ing by scrutinization (tīraṇapariññā)—
the contemplation of the earth element by way of the three general characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and non-self; and the full understanding of
abandonment (pahānapariññā)— the abandoning of desire and lust for the earth
element through the supreme path (of arahantship).

8 Bhūtā. MA says that “beings” here signifies only living beings below the heaven
of the Four Great Kings, the lowest of the sense-sphere heavens; the higher
grades of living beings are covered by the terms to follow. MA exemplifies the
application of the three types of conceiv- ing to this situation as follows: When a
person becomes attached to beings as a result of sight, hearing, etc., or desires
rebirth in a certain class of beings, this is conceiv- ing due to craving. When he
ranks himself as superior, equal, or inferior to others, this is conceiving due to
con- ceit. And when he thinks, “Beings are permanent, stable, eternal,” etc., this
is conceiving due to views.

9 MA: The gods of the six sense-sphere heavenly worlds are meant, except for
Māra and his retinue in the heaven of the gods who wield power over others’
creations. See the account of Buddhist cosmology in the Introduction, pp. 45–48.

10 Prajāpati, “lord of creation,” is a name given by the Vedas to Indra, Agni, etc.,
as the highest of the Vedic divinities. But according to MA, Pajāpati here is a
name for Māra because he is the ruler of this “generation” (pajā) made up of
living beings.

11 Brahmā here is Mahābrahmā, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a
new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle. The Ministers
of Brahmā and the Assembly of Brahmā—the other deities whose position  is
determined by attainment of the first jhāna—are also included.

12 MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the second jhāna—
the gods of Limited Radiance and the gods of Immeasurable Radiance—should
be included, for all these occupy a single level.

13 MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the third jhāna—the
gods of Limited Glory and the gods of Immeasurable Glory—should be included.

14 These are divinities on the plane of the fourth jhāna.

15 Abhibhū. MA says this term is a designation for the non-percipient realm,
called thus because it vanquishes (abhibhavati) the four immaterial aggregates.
The identi- fication sounds contrived, especially because the word “abhibhū” is
a masculine singular noun. Elsewhere (MN 49.5) the word appears as part of
Baka the Brahmā’s claim to theocratic hegemony, yet MA rejects identifying the
Abhibhū with Brahmā here as a redundancy.


16 This and the next three sections deal with conceiving in relation to the four
immaterial planes of existence—the cosmological counterparts of the four
immaterial medita- tive attainments. With §18 the division of conceiving by way
of planes of existence is completed.

17 In these four sections the phenomena comprising per- sonal identity are
considered as objects of perception clas- sified into the four categories of the
seen, heard, sensed, and cognized. Here, sensed (muta) signifies the data of
smell, taste, and touch, cognized (viññāta) the data of intro- spection, abstract
thought, and imagination. The objects of perception are “conceived” when they
are cognized in terms of “mine,” “I,” and “self,” or in ways that generate craving,
conceit, and views.


18 In this section and the next, the phenomena compris- ing personal identity are
treated as twofold—by way of unity and diversity. The emphasis on unity (ekatta),
MA informs us, is characteristic of one who attains the jhānas, in which the mind
occurs in a single mode on a single object. The emphasis on diversity (nānatta)
prevails in the case of the non-attainer who lacks the overwhelming uni- tive
experience of jhānas. Conceivings stressing diversity come to expression in
philosophies of pluralism, those stressing unity in philosophies of the monistic
type.


19 In this section, all phenomena of personal identity are collected together and
shown as singlefold. This idea of totality can form the basis for philosophies of
the pan- theistic or monistic type, depending on the relation pos- ited between
the self and the all.

20 MA understands “Nibbāna” here to refer to the five kinds of “supreme Nibbāna
here and now” included among the sixty-two wrong views of the Brahmajāla
Sutta (DN 1.3.19–25/i.36–38), that is, Nibbāna identified with the full enjoyment
of sense pleasures or with the four jhānas. Enjoying this state, or yearning for it,
he conceives it with craving. Priding himself on attaining it, he con- ceives it with
conceit. Holding this imaginary Nibbāna to be permanent, etc., he conceives it
with views.

21 The sekha, the disciple in higher training, is one who has reached any of the
three lower planes of sanctity— stream-entry, once-returning, or non-returning—
but must still train further in order to reach the goal, arah- antship, the supreme
security from bondage. MN 53 is devoted to expounding the training he must
undertake. The arahant is sometimes described as asekha, one beyond training,
in the sense that he has completed the training  in the Noble Eightfold Path. Ñm
rendered sekha as “ini- tiate” and asekha as “adept,” which have been changed
here to avoid their “esoteric” connotations.

22 It should be noted that, whereas the ordinary man is said to perceive each of
the bases, the one in higher training is said to directly know them (abhijānāti).
MA explains that he knows them with distinguished knowledge, knows them in
accordance with their real nature as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Ñm
rendered: “From earth he has direct knowledge of earth.”

23 The disciple in higher training is urged by the Buddha to refrain from conceiving
and delight because the disposi- tions to these mental processes still remain
within him. With his attainment of stream-entry he eradicated the fetter of
identity view and thus can no longer conceive  in terms of wrong views. But the
defilements of craving and conceit are only uprooted by the path of arahantship,
and thus the sekha remains vulnerable to the conceivings to which they are
capable of giving rise. Whereas direct knowledge (abhiññā) is the province of
both the sekha and the arahant, full understanding (pariññā) is the province
exclusively of the arahant, as it involves the full abandon- ing of all defilements.

24 This is the stock description of the arahant, repeated in many suttas.

25 When ignorance has been abolished by the attainment of full understanding,
the subtlest dispositions to craving and conceit are also eradicated. Thus the
arahant can no longer engage in conceiving and delight.

26 This section and the following two are stated to show that the arahant does
not conceive, not only because he has fully understood the object, but because
he has eradicated the three unwholesome roots—lust (or greed), hate, and
delusion. The phrase “free from lust through the destruc- tion of lust” is used to
stress that the arahant is not merely temporarily without lust, but has destroyed it
at the most fundamental level. Similarly with hate and delusion.


27 On this word, the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring to himself,
see the Introduction, p. 24. The commentaries give a long detailed etymology,
into which they try to compress virtually the entire Dhamma. The passage has
been translated in Bhikkhu Bodhi, Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views,
pp. 331–44.

28 Pariññātantaṁ tathāgatassa. So BBS and SBJ and MA, though PTS reads
simply pariññātaṁ. MA glosses: “fully understood to the conclusion, fully
understood to the limit, fully understood without remainder.” It explains that while
Buddhas and disciple-arahants are alike in abandoning all defilements, there
is a distinction in their range of full understanding: whereas disciples can attain
Nibbāna after comprehending with insight only a limited number of formations,
Buddhas fully understand all for- mations without exception.

29 This sentence gives a highly compressed statement of the formula of
dependent origination (paṭicca samuppāda), usually expounded in twelve factors
(as in MN 38). As interpreted by MA, “delight” is the craving of the previ- ous
life that brought into being the “suffering” of the five aggregates in the present
life, “being” the kammically determinative aspect of the present life that causes
future birth, followed by future ageing and death. This passage shows the cause
for the Buddha’s elimination of con- ceiving to be his penetration of dependent
origination on the night of his enlightenment. The mention of “delight” (nandī) as
the root of suffering links up with the sutta’s title; moreover, by referring to the
earlier statement that the ordinary person delights in earth, etc., it shows suffering to be the ultimate consequence of delight.

30 MA explains the sequence of ideas thus: The Tathāgata does not conceive
earth and does not delight in earth because he has understood that delight is
the root of suf- fering. Further, by understanding dependent origination, he has
completely abandoned the craving here called “delight” and has awakened to
supreme full enlighten- ment. As a result he does not conceive earth or delight
in earth.

31 The bhikkhus did not delight in the Buddha’s words, apparently because the
discourse probed too deeply into the tender regions of their own conceit, and
perhaps their residual brahmanic views. At a later time, MA tells us, when their
pride had been humbled, the Buddha expounded to these same bhikkhus
the Gotamaka Sutta (AN 3:123/i.276), in the course of which they all attained
arahantship.
