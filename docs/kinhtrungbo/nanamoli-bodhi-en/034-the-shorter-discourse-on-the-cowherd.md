# 34. The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

[225] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the
Blessed One was living in the Vajjian country at Ukkācelā
on the banks of the river Ganges. There he addressed the
bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” — “Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Blessed One said this:

2. “Bhikkhus, there was once a foolish Magadhan cowherd
who, in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn,
without examining the near shore or the further shore of the
river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the other shore in the
Videhan country at a place that had no ford. Then the cattle
bunched together in mid-stream in the river Ganges, and they
met with calamity and disaster.

Why was that? Because that foolish Magadhan cowherd,
in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, without
examining the near shore or the further shore of the river
Ganges, drove his cattle across to the other shore in the
Videhan country at a place that had no ford.

3. “So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins


who are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled
in Māra’s realm and what is outside Māra’s realm, unskilled in
the realm of Death and what is outside the realm of Death — it
will lead to the harm and suffering for a long time of those who
think they should listen to them and place faith in them.

4. “Bhikkhus, there was once a wise Magadhan cowherd
who, in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn,
after examining the near shore and the further shore of the
river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the other shore in the
Videhan country at a place that had a ford.

He made the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd,
enter first, and they breasted the stream of the Ganges and
got safely across to the further shore. He made the strong
cattle and the cattle to be tamed enter next, and they too
breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to
the further shore. He made the heifers and young oxen enter
next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got
safely across to the further shore. He made the calves and the
feeble cattle enter next, and they too breasted the stream of
the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore.

At the time there was a tender calf just born, and being
urged on by its mother’s lowing, it too breasted the stream of
the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore. Why
was that? Because that wise Magadhan cowherd, [226] in the
last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, after examining
the near shore and the further shore of the river Ganges, drove
his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at
a place that had a ford.

5. “So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins
who are skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in
Māra’s realm and what is outside Māra’s realm, skilled in the
realm of Death and what is outside the realm of Death — it


will lead to the welfare and happiness for a long time of those
who think they should listen to them and place faith in them.

6. “Bhikkhus, just as the bulls, the fathers and leaders of
the herd, breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely
across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are
arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life,
done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their
own goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely
liberated through final knowledge — by breasting Māra’s
stream they have gotten safely across to the further shore.

7. “Just as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed
breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the
further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who, with the destruction
of the five lower fetters, will reappear spontaneously [in the
Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbāna without ever
returning from that world — by breasting Māra’s stream they
will get safely across to the further shore.

8. “Just as the heifers and young oxen breasted the stream
of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so
too, those bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters
and with the attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, are oncereturners, returning once to this world to make an end of
suffering — by breasting Māra’s stream they too will get safely
across to the further shore.

9. “Just as the calves and the feeble cattle breasted the
stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further
shore, so too, those bhikkhus who, with the destruction
of three fetters, are stream-enterers, no longer subject to
perdition, bound [for deliverance], headed for enlightenment
— by breasting Māra’s stream they too will get safely across
to the further shore.

10. “Just as that tender calf just born, being urged on by


its mother’s lowing, also breasted the stream of the Ganges
and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those
bhikkhus who are Dhamma-followers and faith-followers —
by breasting Māra’s stream they too will get safely across to
the further shore.368

11. “Bhikkhus, I am [227] skilled in this world and in the
other world, skilled in Māra’s realm and in what is outside
Māra’s realm, skilled in the realm of Death and in what is
outside the realm of Death. It will lead to the welfare and
happiness for a long time of those who think they should listen
to me and place faith in me.”

12. That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime
One had said that, the Teacher said further:

“Both this world and the world beyond

Are well described by the one who knows,

And what is still in Māra’s reach

And what is out of reach of Death.

Knowing directly all the world,

The Enlightened One who understands

Opened the door to the deathless state

By which the safety of Nibbāna may be reached;

For Māra’s stream is breasted now,

Its current blocked, its reeds removed;

Rejoice then, bhikkhus, mightily

And set your hearts where safety lies.”
