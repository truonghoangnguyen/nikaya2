# 49. The Invitation of a Brahmā

[326] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion
the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove,
Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus.” — “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One
said this:


2. “Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was living at Ukkaṭṭhā in
the Subhaga Grove at the root of a royal sāla tree.499 Now
on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in Baka the
Brahmā thus: ‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is
eternal, this is total, this is not subject to pass away; for this is
where one is neither born nor ages nor dies nor passes away
nor reappears, and beyond this there is no other escape.’500

3. “I knew with my mind the thought in the mind of Baka
the Brahmā, so just as quickly as a strong man might extend
his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, I vanished from the
root of the royal sāla tree in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkaṭṭhā
and appeared in that Brahma-world. Baka the Brahmā saw
me coming in the distance and said:

‘Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir! It is long, good sir,
since you found an opportunity to come here. Now, good sir,
this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is total,
this is not subject to pass away; for this is where one is neither
born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears, and
beyond this there is no other escape.’

4. “When this was said, I told Baka the Brahmā:

‘The worthy Baka the Brahmā has lapsed into ignorance;
he has lapsed into ignorance in that he says of the impermanent
that it is permanent, of the transient that it is everlasting, of the
non-eternal that it is eternal, of the incomplete that it is total,
of what is subject to pass away that it is not subject to pass
away, of where one is born, ages, dies, passes away, and
reappears, that here one is neither born nor ages nor dies
nor passes away nor reappears; and when there is another
escape beyond this, he says there is no other escape beyond
this.’

5. “Then Māra the Evil One took possession of a member
of the Brahmā’s Assembly,501 and he told me:


‘Bhikkhu, bhikkhu, do not disparage him, do not disparage
him; for this Brahmā is the Great Brahmā, [327] the Overlord,
the Untranscended, of Infallible Vision, Wielder of Mastery,
Lord Maker and Creator, Most High Providence, Master and
Father of those that are and ever can be.

Before your time, bhikkhu, there were recluses and
brahmins in the world who condemned earth and were
disgusted with earth,502 who condemned water and were
disgusted with water, who condemned fire and were disgusted
with fire, who condemned air and were disgusted with air,

who condemned beings and were disgusted with beings,
who condemned gods and were disgusted with gods, who
condemned Pajāpati and were disgusted with Pajāpati, who
condemned Brahmā and were disgusted with Brahmā; and
on the dissolution of the body, when their life was cut off, they
became established in an inferior body.503

Before your time, bhikkhu, there were also recluses
and brahmins in the world who lauded earth and delighted
in earth,504 who lauded water and delighted in water, who
lauded fire and delighted in fire, who lauded air and delighted
in air,

who lauded beings and delighted in beings, who lauded
gods and delighted in gods, who lauded Pajāpati and delighted
in Pajāpati, who lauded Brahmā and delighted in Brahmā; and
on the dissolution of the body, when their life was cut off, they
became established in a superior body.505

So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: Be sure, good sir, to do only
as the Brahmā says; never overstep the word of the Brahmā.
If you overstep the word of the Brahmā, bhikkhu, then, like a
man using a stick to chase away the goddess of luck when
she approaches, or like a man missing the earth with his
hands and feet as he slips into a deep chasm, so it will befall


you, bhikkhu.

Be sure, good sir, to do only as the Brahmā says; never
overstep the word of the Brahmā. Do you not see the Brahmā’s
Assembly seated here, bhikkhu?’ And Māra the Evil One thus
called to witness the Brahmā’s Assembly.506

6. “When this was said, I told Māra the Evil One:

‘I know you, Evil One. Do not think: “He does not know me.”
You are Māra, Evil One, and the Brahmā and the Brahmā’s
Assembly and the members of the Brahmā’s Assembly have
all fallen into your hands, they have all fallen into your power.

You, Evil One, think: “This one too has fallen into my
hands, he too has fallen into my power”; but I have not fallen
into your hands, Evil One, I have not fallen into your power.’

7. “When this was said, Baka the Brahmā told me:

‘Good sir, I say of the permanent that it is permanent,

[328] of the everlasting that it is everlasting, of the eternal that
it is eternal, of the total that it is total, of what is not subject
to pass away that it is not subject to pass away, of where
one is neither born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor
reappears that here one is neither born nor ages nor dies nor
passes away nor reappears; and when there is no escape
beyond this, I say that there is no escape beyond this.

Before your time, bhikkhu, there were recluses and
brahmins in the world whose asceticism lasted as long as your
whole life. They knew, when there is another escape beyond,
that there is another escape beyond, and when there is no
other escape beyond, that there is no other escape beyond.

So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: You will find no other escape
beyond, and eventually you will reap only weariness and
disappointment. If you will hold to earth, you will be close
to me, within my domain, for me to work my will upon and


punish.507 If you hold to water… to fire… to air… to beings…
to gods… to Pajāpati… to Brahmā, you will be close to me,
within my domain, for me to work my will upon and punish.’

8. “‘I know that too, Brahmā. If I will hold to earth, I shall
be close to you, within your domain, for you to work your will
upon and punish. If I will hold to water… to fire… to air… to
beings… to gods… to Pajāpati… to Brahmā, I shall be close
to you, within your domain, for you to work your will upon and
punish.

Further, I understand your reach and your sway to extend
thus: Baka the Brahmā has this much power, this much might,
this much influence.’

“‘Now, good sir, how far do you understand my reach and
my sway to extend?’

9. “‘As far as moon and sun revolve

Shining and lighting up the quarters,

Over a thousandfold such world

Does your sovereignty extend.

And there you know the high and low,

And those with lust and free from lust,

The state that is thus and otherwise,

The coming and going of beings.

Brahmā, I understand your reach and your sway to extend
thus: Baka the Brahmā has this much power, this much might,

[329] this much influence.508

10. “‘But, Brahmā, there are three other bodies, which
you neither know nor see, and which I know and see. There is
the body called [the gods of] Streaming Radiance, from which
you passed away and reappeared here.509


Because you have dwelt here long, your memory of that
has lapsed, and hence you do not know or see it, but I know
and see it.

Thus, Brahmā, in regard to direct knowledge I do not
stand merely at the same level as you, how then could I know
less? Rather, I know more than you.510

“‘There is the body called [the gods of] Refulgent Glory…
There is the body called [the gods of] Great Fruit. You do not
know or see that, but I know and see it.

Thus, Brahmā, in regard to direct knowledge I do not
stand merely at the same level as you, how then could I know
less? Rather, I know more than you.

11. “‘Brahmā, having directly known earth as earth,
and having directly known that which is not partaken of the
earthness of earth, I did not claim to be earth, I did not claim
to be in earth, I did not claim to be apart from earth, I did not
claim earth to be “mine,” I did not affirm earth.511

Thus, Brahmā, in regard to direct knowledge I do not
stand merely at the same level as you, how then could I know
less? Rather, I know more than you.

12–23. “‘Brahmā, having directly known water as water…
fire as fire… air as air… beings as beings… gods as gods…
Pajāpati as Pajāpati… Brahmā as Brahmā… the gods of
Streaming Radiance as the gods of Streaming Radiance… the
gods of Refulgent Glory as the gods of Refulgent Glory… the
gods of Great Fruit as the gods of Great Fruit… the Overlord
as the Overlord…

all as all, and having directly known that which is not
partaken of the allness of all, I did not claim to be all, I did not
claim to be in all, I did not claim to be apart from all, I did not
claim all to be “mine,” I did not affirm all.


Thus, Brahmā, in regard to direct knowledge, I do not
stand merely at the same level as you, how then could I know
less? Rather, I know more than you.’

24. “‘Good sir, if that is not partaken of by the allness of
all, may it not turn out to be vacuous and empty for you!’512

25. “‘Consciousness non-manifesting, Boundless,
luminous all-round:513 that is not partaken of by the earthness
of earth, that is not partaken of by the waterness of water…

[330]… that is not partaken of by the allness of all.’

26. “‘Good sir, I shall vanish from you.’

“‘Vanish from me if you can, Brahmā.’

“Then Baka the Brahmā, saying: ‘I shall vanish from the
recluse Gotama, I shall vanish from the recluse Gotama,’ was
unable to vanish. Thereupon I said:

‘Brahmā, I shall vanish from you.’

“‘Vanish from me if you can, good sir.’

“Then I performed such a feat of supernormal power that
the Brahmā and the Brahmā’s Assembly and the members of
the Brahmā’s Assembly could hear my voice but could not see
me. After I had vanished, I uttered this stanza:

27. “‘Having seen fear in being

And [having seen] that being will cease to be,

I did not welcome any kind of being,

Nor did I cling to delight.’514

28. “At that the Brahmā and the Brahmā’s Assembly and
the members of the Brahmā’s Assembly were struck with
wonder and amazement, saying: ‘It is wonderful, sirs, it is
marvellous, the great power and great might of the recluse
Gotama!


We have never before seen or heard of any other recluse
or brahmin who had such great power and such great might as
has this recluse Gotama, who went forth from a Sakyan clan.
Sirs, though living in a generation that delights in being, that
takes delight in being, that rejoices in being, he has extirpated
being together with its root.’

29. “Then Māra the Evil One took possession of a member
of the Brahmā’s Assembly, and he said to me:

‘Good sir, if that is what you know, if that is what you have
discovered, do not guide your [lay] disciples or those gone
forth, do not teach the Dhamma to your [lay] disciples or to
those gone forth, have no yearning for [lay] disciples or for
those gone forth.

Before your time, bhikkhu, there were recluses and
brahmins in the world claiming to be accomplished and fully
enlightened, and they guided their [lay] disciples and those
gone forth; they taught the Dhamma to their [lay] disciples and
to those gone forth; they had a yearning for [lay] disciples and
for those gone forth; and on the dissolution of the body, when
their life was cut off, they became established in an inferior
body.

Before your time, bhikkhu, there were also recluses and
brahmins in the world claiming to be accomplished and fully
enlightened, [331] and they did not guide their [lay] disciples
or those gone forth; they did not teach the Dhamma to their

[lay] disciples or to those gone forth; they had no yearning for

[lay] disciples or for those gone forth; and on the dissolution of
the body, when their life was cut off, they became established
in a superior body.

So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: Be sure, good sir, to abide
inactive, devoted to a pleasant abiding here and now; this is
better left undeclared, and so, good sir, do not advise anyone


else.’515

30. “When this was said, I told Māra the Evil One: ‘I know
you, Evil One. Do not think: “He does not know me.” You are
Māra, Evil One. It is not out of compassion for their welfare
that you speak thus, it is without compassion for their welfare
that you speak thus. You think thus, Evil One: “Those to whom
the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma will escape from
my sphere.”

Those recluses and brahmins of yours, Evil One, who
claimed to be fully enlightened, were not fully enlightened. But
I, who claim to be fully enlightened, am fully enlightened.

If the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma to disciples he
is such, Evil One, and if the Tathāgata does not teach the
Dhamma to disciples he is such.516 If the Tathāgata guides
disciples he is such, Evil One, and if the Tathāgata does not
guide disciples he is such.

Why is that? Because the Tathāgata has abandoned the
taints that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death; he has
cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done
away with them so that they are no longer subject to future
arising. Just as a palm tree whose crown is cut off is incapable
of further growth,

so too, the Tathāgata has abandoned the taints that defile
them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away
with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising.’”

31. Thus, because Māra was unable to reply, and because

[it began] with the Brahmā’s invitation, this discourse is entitled
“On the Invitation of a Brahmā.”
