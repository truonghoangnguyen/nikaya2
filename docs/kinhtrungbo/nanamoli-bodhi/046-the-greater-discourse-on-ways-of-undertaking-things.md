# 46. The Greater Discourse on Ways of Undertaking Things

1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed
One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s
Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” —
“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:

2. “Bhikkhus, for the most part beings have this wish,
desire, and longing: ‘If only unwished for, undesired,
disagreeable things would diminish and wished for, desired,
agreeable things would increase!’

Yet although beings have this wish, desire, and longing,
unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things increase for
them and wished for, desired, agreeable things diminish. Now,
bhikkhus, what do you think is the reason for that?”

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed
One, [310] guided by the Blessed One, have the Blessed One
as their resort. It would be good if the Blessed One would
explain the meaning of these words. Having heard it from the
Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”

“Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely to what I shall
say.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said
this:

3. “Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person who has
no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled
and undisciplined in their Dhamma, does not know what things
should be cultivated and what things should not be cultivated,
he does not know what things should be followed and what
things should not be followed.


Not knowing this, he cultivates things that should not
be cultivated and does not cultivate things that should be
cultivated, he follows things that should not be followed and
does not follow things that should be followed.481

It is because he does this that unwished for, undesired,
disagreeable things increase for him and wished for, desired,
agreeable things diminish. Why is that? That is what happens
to one who does not see.

4. “The well-taught noble disciple who has regard for
noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma,
who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in
their Dhamma, knows what things should be cultivated and
what things should not be cultivated, he knows what things
should be followed and what things should not be followed.

Knowing this, he cultivates things that should be cultivated
and does not cultivate things that should not be cultivated,
he follows things that should be followed and does not follow
things that should not be followed.

It is because he does this that unwished for, undesired,
disagreeable things diminish for him and wished for, desired,
agreeable things increase. Why is that? That is what happens
to one who sees.

5. “Bhikkhus, there are four ways of undertaking things.
What are the four?

There is a way of undertaking things that is painful now
and ripens in the future as pain.

There is [311] a way of undertaking things that is pleasant
now and ripens in the future as pain.

There is a way of undertaking things that is painful now
and ripens in the future as pleasure.


There is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now
and ripens in the future as pleasure.

(THE IGNORANT PERSON)

6. (1) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing
this way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in
the future as pain, does not understand it as it actually is thus:
‘This way of undertaking things is painful now and ripens in
the future as pain.’

Not knowing it, not understanding it as it actually is, the
ignorant one cultivates it and does not avoid it; because
he does so, unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things
increase for him and wished for, desired, agreeable things
diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to one who does
not see.

7. (2) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing
this way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens
in the future as pain, does not understand it as it actually is
thus: ‘This way of undertaking things is pleasant now and
ripens in the future as pain.’

Not knowing it, not understanding it as it actually is, the
ignorant one cultivates it and does not avoid it; because he
does so, unwished for… things increase for him and wished
for… things diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to
one who does not see.

8. (3) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing
this way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in
the future as pleasure, does not understand it as it actually is
thus: ‘This way of undertaking things is painful now and ripens
in the future as pleasure.’

Not knowing it, not understanding it as it actually is, the
ignorant one does not cultivate it but avoids it; because he


does so, unwished for… things increase for him and wished
for… things diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to
one who does not see.

9. (4) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing
the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens
in the future as pleasure, does not understand it as it actually
is thus: ‘This way of undertaking things is pleasant now and
ripens in the future as pleasure.’

Not knowing it, not understanding it as it actually is, the
ignorant one does not cultivate it but avoids it; because he does
so, [312] unwished for… things increase for him and wished
for… things diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to
one who does not see.

(THE WISE PERSON)

10. (1) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is wise, knowing this
way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the
future as pain, understands it as it actually is thus: ‘This way
of undertaking things is painful now and ripens in the future
as pain.’

Knowing it, understanding it as it actually is, the wise
one does not cultivate it but avoids it; because he does so,
unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things diminish for him
and wished for, desired, agreeable things increase. Why is
that? That is what happens to one who sees.

11. (2) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is wise, knowing this way
of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the
future as pain, understands it as it actually is thus: ‘This way
of undertaking things is pleasant now and ripens in the future
as pain.’

Knowing it, understanding it as it actually is, the wise
one does not cultivate it but avoids it; because he does so,


unwished for… things diminish for him and wished for… things
increase. Why is that? That is what happens to one who sees.

12. (3) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is wise, knowing this
way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in
the future as pleasure, understands it as it actually is thus:
‘This way of undertaking things is painful now and ripens in
the future as pleasure.’

Knowing it, understanding it as it actually is, the wise
one does not avoid it but cultivates it; because he does so,
unwished for things… diminish for him and wished for… things
increase. Why is that? That is what happens to one who sees.

13. (4) “Now, bhikkhus, one who is wise, knowing this way
of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the
future as pleasure, understands it as it actually is thus: ‘This
way of undertaking things is pleasant now and ripens in the
future as pleasure.’

Knowing it, understanding it as it actually is, the wise
one does not avoid it but cultivates it; because he does so,
unwished for… things diminish for him and wished for… things
increase. Why is that? That is what happens to one who sees.

(THE FOUR WAYS)

14. (1) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things
that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain?

Here, bhikkhus, someone in pain and grief kills living
beings, and he experiences pain and grief that have killing
of living beings as condition. In pain and grief he takes what
is not given… misconducts himself in sensual pleasures…
speaks falsehood… speaks maliciously… speaks harshly…
gossips… is covetous… has a mind of ill will… holds wrong
view, and he experiences pain and grief that have wrong view


as condition.

On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in
a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition,
even in hell. This is called the way of undertaking things that
is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.

15. (2) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things
that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain?

Here, bhikkhus, someone in pleasure and joy kills living
beings, and he experiences pleasure and joy that have killing
of living beings as condition. In pleasure and joy he takes what
is not given… [314]… holds wrong view, and he experiences
pleasure and joy that have wrong view as condition.

On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in
a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition,
even in hell. This is called the way of undertaking things that
is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain.

16. (3) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things
that is painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure?

Here, bhikkhus, someone in pain and grief abstains from
killing living beings, and he experiences pain and grief that
have abstention from killing living beings as condition. In pain
and grief he abstains from taking what is not given… from
misconduct in sensual pleasures… from speaking falsehood…
from speaking maliciously… from speaking harshly… from
gossiping… he is not covetous… he does not have a mind of
ill will… [315]… he holds right view, and he experiences pain
and grief that have right view as condition.

On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears
in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. This is
called the way of undertaking things that is painful now and
ripens in the future as pleasure.


17. (4) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things
that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure?

Here, bhikkhus, someone in pleasure and joy abstains
from killing living beings, and he experiences pleasure and joy
that have abstention from killing living beings as condition. In
pleasure and joy he abstains from taking what is not given…
he holds right view, and he experiences pleasure and joy that
have right view as condition.

On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears
in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. This is
called the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and
ripens in the future as pleasure.

(THE SIMILES)

18. (1) “Bhikkhus, suppose there were a bitter gourd
mixed with poison, and a man came who wanted to live, not
to die, who wanted pleasure and recoiled from pain, and they
told him:

‘Good man, this bitter gourd is mixed with poison. Drink
from it if you want; [316] as you drink from it, its colour, smell,
and taste will not agree with you, and after drinking from it,
you will come to death or deadly suffering.’

Then he drank from it without reflecting and did not
relinquish it. As he drank from it, its colour, smell, and taste
did not agree with him, and after drinking from it, he came to
death or deadly suffering.

Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking things that
is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.

19. (2) “Suppose there were a bronze cup of beverage
possessing a good colour, smell, and taste, but it was mixed
with poison, and a man came who wanted to live, not to die,
who wanted pleasure and recoiled from pain, and they told


him:

‘Good man, this bronze cup of beverage possesses a
good colour, smell, and taste, but it is mixed with poison. Drink
from it if you want; as you drink from it, its colour, smell, and
taste will agree with you, but after drinking from it, you will
come to death or deadly suffering.’

Then he drank from it without reflecting and did not
relinquish it. As he drank from it, its colour, smell, and taste
agreed with him, but after drinking from it, he came to death
or deadly suffering.

Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking things that
is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain.

20. (3) “Suppose there were fermented urine mixed with
various medicines, and a man came sick with jaundice, and
they told him:

‘Good man, this fermented urine is mixed with various
medicines. Drink from it if you want; as you drink from it,
its colour, smell, and taste will not agree with you, but after
drinking from it, you will be well.’

Then he drank from it after reflecting, and did not relinquish
it. As he drank from it, its colour, taste, and smell did not agree
with him, but after drinking from it, he became well.

Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking things that
is painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure.

21. (4) “Suppose there were curd, honey, ghee, and
molasses mixed together, and a man with dysentery came,
and they told him:

‘Good man, [317] this is curd, honey, ghee, and molasses
mixed together. Drink from it if you want; as you drink from
it, its colour, smell, and taste will agree with you, and after


drinking from it you will be well.’

Then he drank from it after reflecting, and did not relinquish
it. As he drank from it, its colour, smell, and taste agreed with
him, and after drinking from it, he became well.

Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking things that
is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure.

22. “Just as, in autumn, in the last month of the rainy
season, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun rises
above the earth dispelling all darkness from space with its
shining and beaming and radiance,

so too, the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now
and ripens in the future as pleasure dispels with its shining
and beaming and radiance any other doctrines whatsoever of
ordinary recluses and brahmins.”

That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.
