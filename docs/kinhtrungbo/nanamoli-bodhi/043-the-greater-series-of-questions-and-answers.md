# 43. The Greater Series of Questions and Answers

[292] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion
the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove,
Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when it was evening, the
venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita rose from meditation, went to the
venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.428
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat
down at one side and said to the venerable Sāriputta:

(WISDOM)

2. “‘One who is unwise, one who is unwise’ is said, friend.
With reference to what is this said, ‘one who is unwise’?”

“‘One does not wisely understand, one does not wisely
understand,’ friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’
And what doesn’t one wisely understand?

One does not wisely understand: ‘This is suffering’;

one does not wisely understand: ‘This is the origin of
suffering’;

one does not wisely understand: ‘This is the cessation of
suffering’;

one does not wisely understand: ‘This is the way leading
to the cessation of suffering.’

‘One does not wisely understand, one does not wisely
understand,’ friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’”

Saying, “Good, friend,” the venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita
delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Sāriputta’s words.


Then he asked him a further question:

3. “‘One who is wise, one who is wise,’ is said, friend. With
reference to what is this said, ‘one who is wise’?”

“‘One wisely understands, one wisely understands,’
friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is wise.’ What does one
wisely understand?

One wisely understands: ‘This is suffering’;

one wisely understands: ‘This is the origin of suffering’;

one wisely understands: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’;

one wisely understands: ‘This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering.’

‘One wisely understands, one wisely understands,’ friend;
that is why it is said, ‘one who is wise.’”429

(CONSCIOUSNESS)

4. “‘Consciousness, consciousness’ is said, friend. With
reference to what is ‘consciousness’ said?”

“‘It cognizes, it cognizes,’ friend; that is why ‘consciousness’
is said.430 What does it cognize?

It cognizes: ‘[This is] pleasant’;

it cognizes: ‘[This is] painful’;

it cognizes: ‘[This is] neither-painful-nor-pleasant.’

‘It cognizes, it cognizes,’ friend; that is why ‘consciousness’
is said.”431

5. “Wisdom and consciousness, friend — are these states
conjoined or disjoined? And is it possible to separate each of
these states from the other in order to describe the difference
between them?”

“Wisdom and consciousness, friend — these states are


conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate
each of these states from the other in order to describe the
difference between them.

For what one wisely understands, that one cognizes, and
what one cognizes, that one wisely understands. [293]

That is why these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and
it is impossible to separate each of these states from the other
in order to describe the difference between them.”432

6. “What is the difference, friend, between wisdom and
consciousness, these states that are conjoined, not disjoined?”

“The difference, friend, between wisdom and
consciousness, these states that are conjoined, not disjoined,
is this: wisdom is to be developed, consciousness is to be fully
understood.”433

(FEELING)

7. “‘Feeling, feeling’ is said, friend. With reference to
what is ‘feeling’ said?”

“‘It feels, it feels,’ friend; that is why ‘feeling’ is said. What
does it feel? It feels pleasure, it feels pain, it feels neitherpain-nor-pleasure. ‘It feels, it feels,’ friend, that is why ‘feeling’
is said.”434

(PERCEPTION)

8. “‘Perception, perception,’ is said, friend. With reference
to what is ‘perception’ said?”

“‘It perceives, it perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’
is said. What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives
yellow, it perceives red, and it perceives white. ‘It perceives, it
perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is said.”435

9. “Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend —


are these states conjoined or disjoined? And is it possible
to separate each of these states from the others in order to
describe the difference between them?”

“Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend — these
states are conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to
separate each of these states from the others in order to
describe the difference between them.

For what one feels, that one perceives; and what one
perceives, that one cognizes.

That is why these states are conjoined, not disjoined,
and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the
others in order to describe the difference between them.”436

(KNOWABLE BY MIND ALONE)

10. “Friend, what can be known by purified mindconsciousness released from the five faculties?”

“Friend, by purified mind-consciousness released from
the five faculties

the base of infinite space can be known thus: ‘Space is
infinite’;

the base of infinite consciousness can be known thus:
‘Consciousness is infinite’;

and the base of nothingness can be known thus: ‘There
is nothing.’”437

11. “Friend, with what does one understand a state that
can be known?”

“Friend, one understands a state that can be known with
the eye of wisdom.”438

12. “Friend, what is the purpose of wisdom?”

“The purpose of wisdom, friend, is direct knowledge, its


purpose is full understanding, its purpose is abandoning.”439

(RIGHT VIEW)

[294] 13. “Friend, how many conditions are there for the
arising of right view?”

“Friend, there are two conditions for the arising of right
view: the voice of another and wise attention. These are the
two conditions for the arising of right view.”440

14. “Friend, by how many factors is right view assisted
when it has deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind
for its fruit and benefit, when it has deliverance by wisdom for
its fruit, deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit?”

“Friend, right view is assisted by five factors when it has
deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit
and benefit, when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit,
deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit.

Here, friend, right view is assisted by virtue, learning,
discussion, serenity, and insight.

Right view assisted by these five factors has deliverance
of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit; it
has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by wisdom
for its fruit and benefit.”441

(BEING)

15. “Friend, how many kinds of being are there?”

“There are these three kinds of being, friend: sensesphere being, fine-material being, and immaterial being.”

16. “Friend, how is renewal of being in the future
generated?”

“Friend, renewal of being in the future is generated through
the delighting in this and that on the part of beings who are


hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.”442

17. “Friend, how is renewal of being in the future not
generated?”

“Friend, with the fading away of ignorance, with the arising
of true knowledge, and with the cessation of craving, renewal
of being in the future is not generated.”

(THE FIRST JHĀNA)

18. “Friend, what is the first jhāna?”

“Here, friend, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied
and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion. This is called the first jhāna.”

19. “Friend, how many factors does the first jhāna have?”

“Friend, the first jhāna has five factors. Here, when a
bhikkhu has entered upon the first jhāna, there occur applied
thought, sustained thought, rapture, pleasure, and unification
of mind. That is how the first jhāna has five factors.”

20. “Friend, how many factors are abandoned in the first
jhāna and how many factors are possessed?”

“Friend, in the first jhāna five factors are abandoned and
five factors are possessed. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered
upon the first jhāna, sensual desire is abandoned, ill will is
abandoned, sloth and torpor are abandoned, restlessness
and remorse [295] are abandoned, and doubt is abandoned;
and there occur applied thought, sustained thought, rapture,
pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how in the first jhāna
five factors are abandoned and five factors are possessed.”

(THE FIVE FACULTIES)


21. “Friend, these five faculties each have a separate
field, a separate domain, and do not experience each other’s
field and domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the
nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty.

Now of these five faculties, each having a separate field,
a separate domain, not experiencing each other’s field and
domain, what is their resort, what experiences their fields and
domains?”443

“Friend, these five faculties each have a separate field,
a separate domain, and do not experience each other’s field
and domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose
faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty.

Now these five faculties, each having a separate field,
a separate domain, not experiencing each other’s field and
domain, have mind as their resort, and mind experiences their
fields and domains.”

22. “Friend, as to these five faculties — that is, the eye
faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty,
and the body faculty — what do these five faculties stand in
dependence on?”

“Friend, as to these five faculties — that is, the eye faculty,
the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the
body faculty — these five faculties stand in dependence on
vitality.”444

“Friend, what does vitality stand in dependence on?”

“Vitality stands in dependence on heat.”445

“Friend, what does heat stand in dependence on?”

“Heat stands in dependence on vitality.”

“Just now, friend, we understood the venerable Sāriputta
to have said: ‘Vitality stands in dependence on heat’; and


now we understand him to say: ‘Heat stands in dependence
on vitality.’ How should the meaning of these statements be
regarded?”

“In that case, friend, I shall give you a simile, for some
wise men here understand the meaning of a statement by
means of a simile. Just as when an oil-lamp is burning, its
radiance is seen in dependence on its flame and its flame is
seen in dependence on its radiance; so too, vitality stands
in dependence on heat and heat stands in dependence on
vitality.”

(VITAL FORMATIONS)

23. “Friend, are vital formations things that can be felt
or are vital formations one thing and things that can be felt
another?” [296]

“Vital formations, friend, are not things that can be felt.446
If vital formations were things that can be felt, then a bhikkhu
who has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling
would not be seen to emerge from it. Because vital formations
are one thing and things that can be felt another, a bhikkhu
who has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling
can be seen to emerge from it.”

24. “Friend, when this body is bereft of how many states
is it then discarded and forsaken, left lying senseless like a
log?”447

“Friend, when this body is bereft of three states — vitality,
heat, and consciousness — it is then discarded and forsaken,
left lying senseless like a log.”

25. “Friend, what is the difference between one who is
dead, who has completed his time, and a bhikkhu who has
entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling?”

“Friend, in the case of one who is dead, who has


completed his time, his bodily formations have ceased and
subsided, his verbal formations have ceased and subsided,
his mental formations have ceased and subsided, his vitality
is exhausted, his heat has been dissipated, and his faculties
are fully broken up.

In the case of a bhikkhu who has entered upon the
cessation of perception and feeling, his bodily formations
have ceased and subsided, his verbal formations have
ceased and subsided, his mental formations have ceased
and subsided, but his vitality is not exhausted, his heat has
not been dissipated, and his faculties become exceptionally
clear.448

This is the difference between one who is dead, who has
completed his time, and a bhikkhu who has entered upon the
cessation of perception and feeling.”

(DELIVERANCE OF MIND)

26. “Friend, how many conditions are there for the
attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of
mind?”

“Friend, there are four conditions for the attainment of the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind: here, with
the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure
and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. These are the
four conditions for the attainment of the neither-painful-norpleasant deliverance of mind.”

27. “Friend, how many conditions are there for the
attainment of the signless deliverance of mind?”

“Friend, there are two conditions for the attainment of the
signless deliverance of mind: non-attention to all signs and


attention to the signless element. These are the two conditions
for the attainment of the signless deliverance of mind.”449

28. “Friend, how many conditions are there for the
persistence of the signless deliverance of mind?”

“Friend, there are three conditions for the persistence
of the signless deliverance of mind: [297] non-attention to
all signs, attention to the signless element, and the prior
determination [of its duration].

These are the three conditions for the persistence of the
signless deliverance of mind.”

29. “Friend, how many conditions are there for emergence
from the signless deliverance of mind?”

“Friend, there are two conditions for emergence from the
signless deliverance of mind: attention to all signs and nonattention to the signless element. These are the two conditions
for emergence from the signless deliverance of mind.”

30. “Friend, the immeasurable deliverance of mind, the
deliverance of mind through nothingness, the deliverance of
mind through voidness, and the signless deliverance of mind:
are these states different in meaning and different in name, or
are they one in meaning and different only in name?”

“Friend, the immeasurable deliverance of mind, the
deliverance of mind through nothingness, the deliverance of
mind through voidness, and the signless deliverance of mind:
there is a way in which these states are different in meaning
and different in name, and there is a way in which they are
one in meaning and different only in name.

31. “What, friend, is the way in which these states are
different in meaning and different in name? Here a bhikkhu
abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the


fourth;

so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as
to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world
with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.

He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
compassion… He abides pervading one quarter with a mind
imbued with altruistic joy… He abides pervading one quarter
with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second,
likewise the third, likewise the fourth;

so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as
to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world
with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. This is
called the immeasurable deliverance of mind.

32. “And what, friend, is the deliverance of mind through
nothingness? Here, with the complete surmounting of the
base of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness.
This is called the deliverance of mind through nothingness.

33. “And what, friend, is the deliverance of mind through
voidness? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of
a tree or to an empty hut, reflects thus: ‘This is void of a self or
of what belongs to a self.’ [298] This is called the deliverance
of mind through voidness.450

34. “And what, friend, is the signless deliverance of mind?
Here, with non-attention to all signs, a bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the signless concentration of mind. This is called
the signless deliverance of mind.451 This is the way in which
these states are different in meaning and different in name.

35. “And what, friend, is the way in which these states are


one in meaning and different only in name? Lust is a maker of
measurement, hate is a maker of measurement, delusion is a
maker of measurement.452

In a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, these are
abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, done
away with so that they are no longer subject to future arising.

Of all the kinds of immeasurable deliverance of mind,
the unshakeable deliverance of mind is pronounced the best.
Now that unshakeable deliverance of mind is void of lust, void
of hate, void of delusion.453

36. “Lust is a something, hate is a something, delusion
is a something.454 In a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed,
these are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm
stump, done away with so that they are no longer subject to
future arising.

Of all the kinds of deliverance of mind through nothingness,
the unshakeable deliverance of mind is pronounced the
best.455 Now that unshakeable deliverance of mind is void of
lust, void of hate, void of delusion.

37. “Lust is a maker of signs, hate is a maker of signs,
delusion is a maker of signs.456 In a bhikkhu whose taints
are destroyed, these are abandoned, cut off at the root, made
like a palm stump, done away with so that they are no longer
subject to future arising.

Of all the kinds of signless deliverance of mind, the
unshakeable deliverance of mind is pronounced the best.457
Now that unshakeable deliverance of mind is void of lust, void
of hate, void of delusion. This is the way in which these states
are one in meaning and different only in name.”458

That is what the venerable Sāriputta said. The venerable
Mahā Koṭṭhita was satisfied and delighted in the venerable


Sāriputta’s words.
