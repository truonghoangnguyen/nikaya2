# 152. Discourse
 on the
 Development of the Sense Organs[1]

## Indriya-Bhāvanā Sutta

#### [346] [298]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Kajaṅgalā in the Mukhelu Grove.[2]

 Then the brahman youth Uttara,
 a pupil of Pārāsariya,[3]
 approached the Lord;
 having approached [347] him,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord,
 and when he had conversed in a friendly and courteous way
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus
 to the brahman youth Uttara,
 a pupil of Pārāsariya,
 as he was sitting down
 at a respectful distance:

 "Uttara, does Pārāsariya the brahman teach
 the development of the sense-organs
 to his disciples?"

 "Good Gotama, the brahman Pārāsariya teaches
 the development of the sense-organs
 to his disciples."

 "But in what way, Uttara,
 does Pārāsariya the brahman teach
 the development of the sense-organs
 to his disciples?"

 "As to this, good Gotama,
 one should not see material shapes with the eye,
 one should not hear sounds with the ear.
 It is thus, good Gotama,
 that the brahman Pārāsariya teaches
 the development of the sense-organs
 to his disciples."

 "This being so, Uttara,
 then according to what Pārāsariya the brahman says
 a blind man must have his sense-organ developed,
 a deaf man must have his sense-organ developed.
 For a blind man, Uttara,
 does not see material shape with his eye,
 nor does a deaf man hear a sound with his ear."

 When this had been said,
 the brahman youth Uttara,
 a pupil of Pārāsariya,
 sat silent, ashamed,
 his shoulders drooped,
 his face downcast,
 brooding,
 speechless.

 Then the Lord,
 knowing that Uttara,
 a pupil of Pārāsariya,
 was sitting silent, ashamed,
 his shoulders drooped,
 his face downcast,
 brooding,
 speechless,
 addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:

 "Ānanda, the brahman Pārāsariya teaches his disciples
 the development of the sense-organs in one way;[4]
 but in the discipline for an ariyan
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 is otherwise."[4a]

 "It is the right time for this, Lord,
 it is the right time for this, Well-farer,
 that the Lord [299] should teach
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 (as it is) in the discipline for an ariyan.
 When the monks have heard the Lord,
 they will remember."

 "Well than, Ānanda,
 listen, attend carefully and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:
 "And what, Ānanda,
 is the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in the discipline for an ariyan?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 when a monk has seen a material shape with the eye
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both [348] liked and disliked.[5]

 He comprehends thus:
 'This that is liked is arising in me,
 this that is disliked is arising,
 this that is both liked and disliked is arising,
 and this that arises
 is because it is constructed, is gross.
 (But) this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say equanimity.'

 So whether what is arising in him
 is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 it is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.[6]

 Ānanda, it is as if a man with vision,
 having opened his eyes
 should close them,
 or having closed them
 should open them.
 Even so, Ānanda,
 such is the speed,
 such the swiftness,
 such the ease
 with which anything that has arisen,
 whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,
 this is called
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in regard to material shapes
 cognisable by the eye.

 And again, Ānanda,
 when a monk has heard a sound with the ear
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 He comprehends thus:
 'This that is liked is arising in me,
 this that is disliked is arising,
 this that is both liked and disliked is arising,
 and this that arises
 is because it is constructed, is gross.
 (But) this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say equanimity.'

 So whether what is arising in him
 is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 it is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 Ānanda, as a strong man
 can snap his fingers with ease.
 Even so, Ānanda,
 such is the speed,
 such the swiftness,
 such the ease
 with which anything that has arisen,
 whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,
 this is called
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in regard to sounds
 cognisable by the ear.

 And again, Ānanda, when a monk has smelt a smell with the nose
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 He comprehends thus:
 'This that is liked is arising in me,
 this that is disliked is arising,
 this that is both liked and disliked is arising,
 and this that arises
 is because it is constructed, is gross.
 (But) this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say equanimity.'

 So whether what is arising in him
 is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 it is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 As, [300] Ānanda, the rain-drops slide off a lotus-leaf
 that is slightly on the slant
 and do not remain.
 Even so, Ānanda,
 such is the speed,
 such the swiftness,
 such the ease
 with which anything that has arisen,
 whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,
 this is called
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in regard to smells
 cognisable by the nose.

 And again, Ānanda, when a monk has tasted a flavour with the tongue
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 He comprehends thus:
 'This that is liked is arising in me,
 this that is disliked is arising,
 this that is both liked and disliked is arising,
 and this that arises
 is because it is constructed, is gross.
 (But) this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say equanimity.'

 So whether what is arising in him
 is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 it is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 As, Ānanda, when a fleck of mucus
 has collected on the tip of his tongue
 a strong man can easily spit it out.
 Even so, Ānanda,
 such is the speed,
 such the swiftness,
 such the ease
 with which anything that has arisen,
 whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,
 this [349] is called
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in regard to flavours
 cognisable by the tongue.

 And again, Ānanda, when a monk has felt a touch with the body
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 He comprehends thus:
 'This that is liked is arising in me,
 this that is disliked is arising,
 this that is both liked and disliked is arising,
 and this that arises
 is because it is constructed, is gross.
 (But) this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say equanimity.'

 So whether what is arising in him
 is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 it is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.
 As, Ānanda, a strong man
 can stretch out his bent arm
 or can bend back his outstretched arm.
 Even so, Ānanda,
 such is the speed,
 such the swiftness,
 such the ease
 with which anything that has arisen,
 whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,
 this is called
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in regard to touches
 cognisable by the body.

 And again, Ānanda, when a monk has cognised a mental state with the mind
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 He comprehends thus:
 'This that is liked is arising in me,
 this that is disliked is arising,
 this that is both liked and disliked is arising,
 and this that arises
 is because it is constructed, is gross.
 (But) this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say equanimity.'

 So whether what is arising in him
 is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 it is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 It is, Ānanda, as if a man
 might let two or three drops of water
 fall into a red-hot iron vessel daily.
 Slow, Ānanda,
 would be the falling
 of the drops of water,
 yet quickly
 would they be destroyed and consumed.
 Even so, Ānanda,
 such is the speed,
 such the swiftness,
 such the ease
 with which anything that has arisen,
 whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,
 is (all the same) stopped in him,
 and equanimity remains.

 In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,
 this is called
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in regard to mental states
 cognisable by the mind.

 Even so, Ānanda, is the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 in the discipline for an ariyan.

 And what, Ānanda,
 is a learner's course?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 when a monk has seen a material shape with the eye
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 Because there has arisen
 what is liked,
 because there has arisen
 what is disliked,
 because there has arisen
 what is both liked and disliked,
 he is troubled about it,
 ashamed of it,
 loathes it.

 [301] When he has heard
 a sound with the ear,
 smelt a smell
 with the nose,
 tasted a flavour
 with the tongue,
 felt a touch with the body,
 cognised a mental state
 with the mind
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 Because there has arisen
 what is liked,
 because there has arisen
 what is disliked,
 because there has arisen
 what is both liked and disliked,
 he is troubled about it,
 ashamed of it,
 loathes it.
 Just so, Ānanda,
 is a learner's course.

 And what, Ānanda,
 is the ariyan whose sense-organs are developed?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 when a monk has seen a material shape with the eye
 there [350] arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked;
 when a monk has heard a sound with the ear
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked;
 when a monk has smelt a smell with the nose
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked;
 when a monk has tasted a flavour with the tongue
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked;
 when a monk has felt a touch with the body
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked;
 when a monk has cognised a mental state with the mind
 there arises what is liked,
 there arises what is disliked,
 there arises what is both liked and disliked.

 If he desire thus:
 'May I abide
 not perceiving impurity in impurity,'[7]
 he abides there
 not perceiving impurity.

 If he desire:
 'May I abide
 perceiving impurity in purity,'
 he abides there
 perceiving impurity.

 If he desire:
 'May I abide
 not perceiving impurity in impurity and in purity,'
 he abides there
 not perceiving impurity.

 If he desire:
 'May I abide
 perceiving impurity in purity and impurity,'
 he abides there
 perceiving impurity.

 If he desire:
 'May I, having avoided both impurity and purity,

 [302] abide in equanimity,
 mindful and clearly conscious,'
 he abides there
 in equanimity,
 mindful and clearly conscious.

 Even so, Ānanda,
 is the ariyan whose sense-organs are developed.

 Thus, Ānanda,
 there has been taught by me
 the incomparable development of the sense-organs
 (as it is) in the discipline for an ariyan,
 there has been taught a learner's course,
 there has been taught the ariyan
 whose sense-organs are developed.

 Whatever, Ānanda, is to be done
 out of compassion by a teacher
 seeking the welfare of his disciples
 and compassionate for them,
 that has been done by me for you.

 These, Ānanda, are the roots of trees,
 these are empty places.
 Meditate, Ānanda,
 do not be slothful,
 do not be remorseful later.
 This is our instruction for you."

 Thus spoke the Lord.
 Delighted, the venerable Ānanda
 rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
