# 86. Discourse with Aṅgulimāla

## Aṅgulimāla Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Now at that time,
 in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosaia[1]
 there was a robber named Aṅgulimāla,[2]
 a hunter,
 bloody-handed,
 bent on death and destruction,
 merciless to living creatures.

 Through him villages were depopulated[3]
 and market towns were depopulated
 and country [285] districts were depopulated.
 From his constant killing of people
 he wore a garland of fingers.

 Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Sāvatthī for almsfood;
 having walked for alms in Sāvatthī,
 returning from the almsgathering after the meal,
 having packed away his lodging,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 he set out along a highway
 towards the robber Aṅgulimāla.

 Cowherds,
 goatherds,
 yeomen farmers
 and travellers
 saw the Lord
 as he was setting out along the highway
 towards the robber Aṅgulimāla.

 Having seen the Lord,
 they spoke thus to him:

 "Do not, recluse,
 set out along this road.

 There is a robber on this road
 called Aṅgulimāla,
 a hunter,
 bloody-handed,
 bent on death and destruction,
 merciless to living creatures.

 Through him villages are depopulated
 and market towns are depopulated
 and country districts are depopulated.
 From his constant killing of people
 he wares a garland of fingers.

 This is a road, recluse,
 along which ten
 or twenty
 or thirty
 or forty men
 set out only after they have collected together,
 and even they are at the mercy
 of the robber Aṅgulimāla."

 When this had been said, the Lord,
 having become silent,
 went on.

 And a second time,
 the cowherds,
 goatherds,
 yeomen farmers
 and travellers
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Do not, recluse,
 set out along this road.

 There is a robber on this road
 called Aṅgulimāla,
 a hunter,
 bloody-handed,
 bent on death and destruction,
 merciless to living creatures.

 Through him villages are depopulated
 and market towns are depopulated
 and country districts are depopulated.
 From his constant killing of people
 he wares a garland of fingers.

 This is a road, recluse,
 along which ten
 or twenty
 or thirty
 or forty men
 set out only after they have collected together,
 and even they are at the mercy
 of the robber Aṅgulimāla."

 And a second time,
 when this had been said, the Lord,
 having become silent,
 went on.

 And a third time,
 the cowherds,
 goatherds,
 yeomen farmers
 and travellers
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Do not, recluse,
 set out along this road.

 There is a robber on this road
 called Aṅgulimāla,
 a hunter,
 bloody-handed,
 bent on death and destruction,
 merciless to living creatures.

 Through him villages are depopulated
 and market towns are depopulated
 and country districts are depopulated.
 From his constant killing of people
 he wares a garland of fingers.

 This is a road, recluse,
 along which ten
 or twenty
 or thirty
 or forty men
 set out only after they have collected together,
 and even they are at the mercy
 of the robber Aṅgulimāla."

 And a third time,
 when this had been said, the Lord,
 having become silent,
 went on.

 The robber Aṅgulimāla saw the Lord coming in the distance;
 on seeing him,
 it occurred to him:

 "Indeed it is wonderful,
 indeed it is marvellous.

 This is a road,
 along which ten
 or twenty
 or thirty
 or forty men
 set out only after they have collected together,
 and even they are at my mercy.

 And now this recluse is coming along alone,
 without a companion,
 it seems from choice.[4]

 Suppose I were to deprive this recluse of life?"
 Then the robber Aṅgulimāla,
 having grasped his sword and shield,
 having armed himself with bow and quiver,
 followed close after the Lord.

 Then the Lord performed such a wonder of psychic power
 that the robber Aṅgulimāla,
 although walking with all his strength,
 was not able to catch up with the Lord
 who was walking at an ordinary pace.

 Then it occurred to the robber Aṅgulimāla:

 'Indeed [286] it is wonderful,
 indeed it is marvellous.

 Although formerly I could attack and seize a running elephant,
 I could attack and seize a running horse,
 I could attack and seize a running chariot,
 I could attack and seize a running deer,
 now I,
 although walking with all my strength,
 am not able to catch up with this recluse
 who is walking at an ordinary pace.

 Standing still,
 he said to the Lord:

 "Stand still, recluse,
 stand still, recluse."

 "I am standing still, Aṅgulimāla,
 you too stand still."

 Then it occurred to the robber Aṅgulimāla:
 "These recluses,
 sons of the Sakyans,
 are truth-speakers,
 approving of truth.

 But yet this recluse,
 while he is walking,
 says:

 'I am standing still, Aṅgulimāla,
 you too stand still.'

 Suppose I were to question this recluse?"

 Then the robber Aṅgulimāla
 spoke out to the Lord in verses:[5]

 "While you are walking, recluse, you say:
 'I am standing still,'
 and you tell me, who am standing still,
 that I am not standing still.

 I ask you, recluse, about this matter:
 How is it that you are standing still,
 yet I am not standing still?"

 "I, Aṅgulimāla, am standing still,
 having for all beings everywhere laid aside the stick,
 But you are unrestrained regarding creatures;
 therefore I am standing still,
 you are not standing still."

 "Long it is since a great sage was honoured by me,
 yet this recluse is penetrating the Great Grove.
 I will soon get rid of evil,
 hearing dhamma in a verse of yours."
 When the robber had spoken thus,
 he hurled his sword and weapons down a cliff,
 into a pit, a chasm.
 The robber honoured the Well-farer's feet;
 there he asked for the going forth.

 The Awakened One and compassionate great sage
 who is the Teacher of the world with its devas,
 Thereupon said to him:
 "Come, monk." This itself was monk's status for him.

 Then the Lord set out on tour for Sāvatthī
 with the venerable Aṅgulimāla as his attendant.

 In due course,
 walking on tour,
 he [287] arrived at Sāvatthī.

 While he was there
 the Lord stayed near Sāvatthī,
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Now at that time, a great concourse of people,
 having gathered together at the gate of King Pasenadi's palace,
 were making a loud noise,
 a great noise,
 saying:

 "There is a robber in your realm, sire,
 called Aṅgulimāla,
 a hunter,
 bloody-handed,
 bent on death and destruction,
 merciless to living creatures.

 Through him villages are depopulated
 and market towns are depopulated
 and country districts are depopulated.

 From his constant killing of people
 he wares a garland of fingers.

 Let the king drive him out."

 Then King Pasenadi,
 with as many as five hundred horses,
 left Sāvatthī early in the morning
 and started for the monastery.

 Having gone by vehicle as far as the ground permitted,
 he dismounted from his vehicle
 and approached the Lord on foot;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus to King Pasenadi
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "What is it, sire?

 Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha angry with you,
 or the Licehavis of Vesālī,
 or some hostile king?"

 "Revered sir,
 it is not that King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha is angry with me,
 or the Licehavis of Vesālī,
 or any hostile king.

 There is a robber in my realm, revered sir,
 named Aṅgulimāla,
 a hunter,
 bloody-handed,
 bent on death and destruction,
 merciless to living creatures.

 Through him villages are depopulated
 and market towns are depopulated
 and country districts are depopulated.

 From his constant killing of people
 he wares a garland of fingers.

 I, revered sir,
 shall never drive him out."

 "But[6] if you, sire,
 were to see the robber Aṅgulimāla,
 having had his hair and beard cut off,
 having donned saffron robes,
 having gone forth from home into homelessness,
 refraining from onslaught on creatures,
 refraining from taking what has not been given,
 refraining from lying speech,
 a one-meal-man,
 a Brahma-farer,
 virtuous,
 of lovely character  what would you do to him?"

 "Revered sir,
 we would salute him
 or rise up before him
 or offer him a seat
 or invite him to the requisites of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 or we would have a proper watch and ward and guard
 provided for him.

 But whence could there be, revered sir,
 such control in moral habit
 for one of bad morality,
 of evil character?"

 Now at that time
 the venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting near the Lord.

 Then the Lord,
 stretching out his right arm,
 spoke thus to King Pasenadi:

 "This, sire,
 is Aṅgulimāla."

 Then King Pasenadi was afraid,
 alarmed
 and his hair stood on end.

 [288] Then the Lord,
 knowing King Pasenadi's terror and agitation
 and that his hair was standing on end,
 spoke thus to King Pasenadi:

 "Do not be afraid, sire,
 do not be afraid, sire;
 you have no cause for fear here."

 Then King Pasenadi's fear and alarm
 and the standing of his hair on end
 all abated.

 Then King Pasenadi approached the venerable Aṅgulimāla;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to the venerable Aṅgulimāla:

 "Revered sir,
 is the master really Aṅgulimāla?"

 "Yes, sire."

 "Of what clan was the master's father?

 Of what clan his mother?"

 "Gagga was my father, sire,
 Mantāni my mother."

 "Revered sir, let the master,
 the son of Gagga and Mantāni,
 be of good cheer.

 I will make an effort
 in the matter of the requisites of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 or we would have a proper watch and ward and guard
 provided for the master,
 the son of Gagga and Mantāni."

 Now at that time the venerable Aṅgulimāla
 was a forest-dweller,
 an almsman,
 a rag-robe wearer,
 one who wore the three robes.

 So the venerable Aṅgulimāla
 spoke thus to King Pasenadi:
 "No, sire,
 I am complete as to the three robes."

 Then King Pasenadi approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is wonderful, revered sir,
 it is marvellous, revered sir,
 how this Lord, revered sir,
 tames the untamed,
 calms the uncalmed,
 helps to quell completely
 those that are not completely quelled.[7]

 Him, revered sir,
 that I was unable to tame
 with stick and sword,
 the Lord has tamed
 without stick or sword.

 Well, I am going now, revered sir,
 I am very busy,
 there is much to be done."

 "You do now, sire,
 that for which you deem it the right time."

 Then King Pasenadi,
 rising from his seat,
 having greeted the Lord,
 departed keeping his right side towards him.
 Then the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.

 And as the venerable Aṅgulimāla was walking in Sāvatthī
 on an uninterrupted round for almsfood,
 he saw a woman in difficult and dangerous labour.

 On seeing her, it occurred to him:

 "Beings are indeed impure,
 beings are indeed impure."

 Then the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 having walked in Sāvatthī for [289] almsfood,
 on returning from the almsgathering after the meal,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Aṅgulimāla spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Now, I, revered sir,
 having dressed in the morning
 was walking in Sāvatthī
 on an uninterrupted round for almsfood,
 and saw a woman in difficult and dangerous labour.

 On seeing her, it occurred to me:

 "Beings are indeed impure,
 beings are indeed impure."
 "Well then, do you, Aṅgulimāla,
 approach Sāvatthī;
 having approached,
 speak thus to that woman:

 'I, sister,
 am not aware of having intentionally deprived any living thing of life
 since I was born.

 By this truth
 may there be well-being for you,
 well-being for the unborn child.'"

 "But would not this be
 deliberate lying on my part, revered sir?

 For, revered sir,
 many living things have been intentionally deprived of life by me."

 "Well then,
 do you, Aṅgulimāla,
 approach Sāvatthī;
 having approached,
 speak thus to that woman:

 'I, sister,
 am not aware of having intentionally deprived any living thing of life
 since I was born of the ariyan birth.

 By this truth
 may there be well-being for you,
 well-being for the unborn child.'"

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 and the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 having answered the Lord in assent,
 approached Sāvatthī;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to that woman:

 "I, sister,
 am not aware of having intentionally deprived any living thing of life
 since I was born of the ariyan birth.

 By this truth
 may there be well-being for you,
 well-being for the unborn child.'"

 Then the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 living alone,
 aloof,
 diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 having soon realised here and now
 by his own super-knowledge
 that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which
 young men of family
 rightly go forth from home into homelessness,
 entering on it,
 abided in it.

 And he knew:

 Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.

 And so the venerable Angulimāla
 was one of the perfected ones.
 Then the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.

 Now at that time
 a clod of earth thrown by one man
 fell on the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 also a stick thrown by another
 and gravel thrown by a third.[8]

 Then the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 with a broken head [290] streaming with blood,
 his bowl smashed,
 and his outer cloak in tatters,
 approached the Lord.

 The Lord saw the venerable Aṅgulimāla coming in the distance;
 seeing him,
 he spoke thus to the venerable Aṅgulimāla:

 "Do you endure it, brahman[9]
 do you endure it, brahman.

 You are experiencing here and now
 the ripening of that kamma
 through the ripening of which
 you would (otherwise) boil in Niraya Hell
 for many years,
 many hundreds of years,
 many thousands of years."

 Then the venerable Aṅgulimāla,
 as he was meditating in private,
 experienced the bliss of freedom,[10]
 and at that time
 uttered this solemn utterance:

 "He[11] who formerly was slothful but afterwards is diligent
 Illumes this world like the moon when freed from a cloud.

 He whose evilly done kamma is closed by what is skilled
 Illumes this world like the moon when freed from a cloud.

 Indeed, he who, a young monk, cleaves to the Awakened One's Dispensation
 Illumines this world like the moon when freed from a cloud.

 Let my foes but hear talk on dhamma,
 let my foes but cleave to the Awakened One's Dispensation,

 Let those men, my foes, but follow dhamma  and, calmed, only it will they accept.

 Let my foes, from speakers on forbearance and commenders of gentleness
 Hear dhamma from time to time and act in conformity with it.

 Such a one would not harm me nor yet any other at all  He would attain the uttermost peace and guard those who have craving and those who have none.[12]

 As[13] ditchers lead the water, as fletchers shape the shaft,
 As joiners shape the timber, so do the wise tame themselves.

 Some[14] are tamed by the stick, goads or whips;
 I, without stick, without weapon, was tamed by Him who is ' Such.'

 [291] My name is 'Harmless,'[15] though once I harmful was.
 Today I am truly named,[16] for I harm no thing at all.

 Once I was the notorious robber Aṅgulimāla;
 Being swept away by the great flood, I came to the Awakened One for
 refuge.

 Once I was the notorious bloody-handed Aṅgulimāla  0 see my going for refuge, becoming's cord[17] removed!

 Me who had wrought such kamma as leads to many a woeful bourn,
 When touched by the ripening of kamma,[18] debtless I enjoy an owner's state.[19]

 Fools,[20] folk poor in wisdom, pursue slothfulness;
 A wise man guards diligence as wealth supreme.

 Pursue[21] not slothfulness, be not acquainted with sensual delights  Meditating with diligence one attains abundant joy.

 Well[22] was (my) coming,[23] there is no departing, nor was I ill-advised
 Among various truths[24] that which I follow is supreme.

 [292] Well was (my) coming, there is no departing, nor was I ill-advised  Won is the threefold knowledge, done is the teaching of the Awakened One."

 Discourse with Aṅgulimāla:
 The Sixth
