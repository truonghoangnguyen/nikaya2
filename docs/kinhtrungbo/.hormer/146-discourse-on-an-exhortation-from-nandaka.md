# 146. Discourse on an Exhortation from Nandaka

## Nandak'ovāda Sutta

#### Thus have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid
 with as many as five hundred nuns
 approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 she stood at a respectful distance.
 As she was standing at a respectful distance,
 Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, [323] let the Lord exhort the nuns;
 revered sir, let the Lord instruct the nuns;
 revered sir, let the Lord make a talk on Dhamma for the nuns."
 Now at that time the monks who were elders used to exhort the nuns in turn;
 but the venerable Nandaka[1] did not want to exhort the nuns in (his) turn.[2]
 So the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:

 "Ānanda, whose turn is it today to exhort the nuns by turn?"

 "It is Nandaka's turn, revered sir,
 to exhort the nuns by turn;
 but this venerable Nandaka, revered sir,
 does not want to exhort the nuns in (his) turn."

 Then the Lord addressed the venerable Nandaka, saying:

 "Exhort the nuns, Nandaka;
 instruct the nuns, Nandaka;
 do you, brahman,[3] make a talk on Dhamma for the nuns."

 "Yes, revered sir," [271] answered the venerable Nandaka in assent to the Lord.

 He dressed in the early morning
 and, taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.
 When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī,
 on returning from the alms-gathering after the meal
 he approached the King's Monastery[4] without a companion.[5]

 Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance,
 and on seeing him they made ready a seat
 and set out water for (washing) the feet.

 The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready
 and as he was sitting down he washed his feet.

 And when those nuns had greeted the venerable Nandaka
 they sat down at a respectful distance.
 The venerable Nandaka spoke thus to those nuns
 as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "Sisters, there will be a talk by way of putting questions.

 Those who understand (each question) should say:
 'We understand';
 those who do not understand should say:
 'We do not understand.'

 [324] But if anyone has any doubt or perplexity
 I should be questioned about it thus:
 'How is this, revered sir?
 What is the meaning of that?'"

 "So far, revered sir, we are pleased and satisfied with the master Nandaka
 in that the master Nandaka invites us."

 "What do you think about this, sisters?
 Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"

 "Impermanent, revered sir."

 "But is what is impermanent, anguish
 or happiness?"

 "Anguish, revered sir."

 "It is right to regard that which is impermanent,
 anguish and liable to alteration as,
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, sisters?
 Is the ear permanent or impermanent?"
 "Impermanent, revered sir."

 "But is what is impermanent, anguish
 or happiness?"

 "Anguish, revered sir."

 "It is right to regard that which is impermanent,
 anguish and liable to alteration as,
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, sisters?
 Is the nose permanent or impermanent?"

 "Impermanent, revered sir."

 "But is what is impermanent, anguish

 "Anguish, revered sir."

 "It is right to regard that which is impermanent,
 anguish and liable to alteration as,
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 this is my self.'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, sisters?

 "Impermanent, revered sir."

 "But is what is impermanent, anguish

 "Anguish, revered sir."

 "It is right to regard that which is impermanent,

 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, sisters?
 Is the mind permanent or impermanent?"

 "Impermanent, revered sir."

 "But is what is impermanent, anguish
 or happiness?"
 "Anguish, revered sir."

 "It is right to [272]regard that which is impermanent,
 anguish and liable to alteration as,
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self.'?"

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 Already, revered sir, by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 it has been well seen by us as it really is that
 'These six internal sense-fields are impermanent.'"

 "It is good, sisters, it is good.

 For it is thus, sisters,
 that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this is seen by an Ariyan disciple
 as it really is.

 What do you think about this, sisters?

 [325] "Is it right to regard that which is impermanent,

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 Already, revered sir, by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 it has been well seen by us as it really is that
 'These six classes of consciousness are impermanent.'"

 "It is good, sisters, it is good.

 For it is thus, sisters,
 that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this is seen by an Ariyan disciple as it really is.

 It is, sisters, like the oil for lighting an oil-lamp
 which is impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and like the wick which is impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and like the flame which is impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and like the light which is impermanent and liable to alteration.

 If anyone, sisters, were to speak thus:
 'The oil for lighting this oil-lamp is impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and the wick is impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and the flame is impermanent and liable to alteration,
 but that which is the light
 — that is permanent, lasting, eternal, not liable to alteration,'
 speaking thus sisters,
 would he be speaking rightly?"

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is, revered sir, that
 if the oil for lighting this oil-lamp be impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and if the wick be impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and if the flame be impermanent and liable to alteration,
 all the more is the light impermanent and liable to alteration."

 "Even so, sisters,
 if anyone should speak thus:
 'These six internal sense-fields are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 but whatever pleasure or pain
 or neither pain nor pleasure
 is experience as a result of these six internal sense-field
 — that is permanent, lasting, eternal,
 not liable to alteration,'
 speaking this, sisters,
 would he be speaking rightly?'

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?
 As a result of this or that condition, revered sir,
 these or those feelings arise.

 [274] From the stopping of this or that condition
 these or those feelings are stopped."

 "It is good, sisters, it is good.

 For it is thus, sisters,
 that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this is seen by an Ariyan disciple as it really is.

 It is, sisters, like the roots of a great, stable and pithy tree
 which are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 like the trunk
 which is impermanent and liable to alteration
 the branches and foliage
 which are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and like the shade
 which is impermanent and liable to alteration.

 If anyone, sisters, were to speak thus: 'The roots of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 the trunk of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 the branches and foliage of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to [326] alteration,
 but that which is its shade
 — that is permanent, lasting, eternal,
 not liable to alteration,
 speaking thus, sisters,
 would he be speaking rightly?'

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?
 It is, revered sir, that if the roots of this great, stable and pithy tree

 From the stopping of this or that condition
 these or those feelings are stopped."

 "It is good, sisters, it is good.

 For it is thus, sisters,
 that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this is seen by an Ariyan disciple as it really is.

 It is, sisters, as if a clever cattle-butcher
 or cattle-butcher's apprentice,
 having killed a cow,
 should dissect the cow with a butcher's sharp knife
 without spoiling the flesh within,
 without spoiling the outer hide,
 and with the butcher's sharp knife
 should cut,
 should cut around,
 should cut all around
 whatever tendons, sinews and ligaments there are there within;

 [275] and having cut,
 cut around,
 cut all around
 and removed the outer hide and,
 having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,
 should then speak thus:
 'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'

 Speaking thus, sisters, would he be speaking rightly?"

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 Although, revered sir, that clever cattle-butcher
 or cattle-butcher's apprentice,
 having killed a cow
 should dissect the cow with a butcher's sharp knife
 without spoiling the flesh within,
 without spoiling the outer hide,
 and with the butcher's sharp knife
 should cut,
 should cut around,
 should cut all around
 whatever tendons, sinews and ligaments there are there within;
 and having cut,
 cut around,
 cut all around
 and removed the outer hide and,
 having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,
 should then speak thus:
 'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'
 yet that cow is not conjoined with that hide."

 "I have made this simile for you, sisters,
 so as to illustrate the meaning.

 This is the meaning here:

 'The flesh within,' sisters,
 is a synonym for the six internal sense-fields.

 'The outer hide,' sisters,
 is a synonym for the six external sense-fields.

 'The tendons, sinews and ligaments within,' sisters,
 is a synonym for delight and attachment.

 'The butcher's sharp knife,' sisters,
 is a synonym for the Ariyan intuitive wisdom,
 the Ariyan intuitive wisdom by which [327] one cuts,
 cuts around
 and cuts all around
 the inner defilement's
 the inner fetters
 and the inner bonds.

 There are, sisters, these seven links in awakening[6]
 from the development and making much of which a monk,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having here and now realized
 by his own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 entering on them abides therein.

 What are the seven?

 Herein, sisters, a monk develops the link in awakening
 that is mindfulness
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is investigation into things
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is energy
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is rapture
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is impassability
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is concentration
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is equanimity
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependent on detachment,
 dependent on cessation,
 ending in abandoning.

 These, sisters, are the seven links in awakening
 from the development and making much of which a monk,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having here and now realized
 by his own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 entering on them abides therein.

 [276] Then the venerable Nandaka,
 having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation,
 dismissed them, saying:

 "Go, sisters, it is time."

 Then these nuns,
 having rejoiced in what the venerable Nandaka had said
 and having given thanks,
 rose from their seats,
 greeted the venerable Nandaka
 keeping their right sides towards him,
 and approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 they stood at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus to these nuns
 as they were standing at a respectful distance:

 "Go, nuns, it is time."

 Then these nuns,
 having greeted the Lord,
 departed keeping their right sides towards him.

 Not long after these nuns had departed
 the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks, as on an Observance day,
 a fourteenth,
 there is neither doubt nor perplexity among the populace
 as to whether the moon is not full[7]
 or whether the moon is full,
 for the moon is then not full,
 even so, monks,
 although these nuns were delighted with Nandaka;'s teaching on Dhamma,
 their aspirations were not fulfilled."

 Then the Lord addressed the venerable Nandaka, saying:

 "Well [328] then, Nandaka,
 you may exhort these nuns
 with this same exhortation
 again tomorrow."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the venerable Nandaka answered the Lord in assent.
 Then the venerable Nandaka dressed in the early morning
 towards the end of that night and,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.
 When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī,
 on returning from the alms-gathering
 after the meal
 he approached the King's Monastery without a companion.

 Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance,
 and on seeing him they made ready a seat
 and set out water for (washing) the feet.

 The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready
 and as he was sitting down he washed his feet.

 And when those nuns had greeted the venerable Nandaka
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 The venerable Nandaka spoke thus to those nuns
 as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "Sisters, there will be a talk by way of putting questions.

 Those who understand (each question) should say:
 'We understand';
 those who do not understand should say:
 'We do not understand.'
 But if anyone has any doubt or perplexity
 I should be questioned about it thus:
 'How is this, revered sir?
 What is the meaning of that?'"

 "So far, revered sir,
 we are pleased and satisfied with the master Nandaka
 in that the master Nandaka invites us."

 It is, sisters, like the oil for lighting an oil-lamp

 What is the reason for this?

 As a result of this or that condition, revered sir,
 these or those feelings arise.

 [274] From the stopping of this or that condition
 these or those feelings are stopped."

 "It is good, sisters, it is good.

 For it is thus, sisters,
 that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this is seen by an Ariyan disciple as it really is.

 It is, sisters, like the roots of a great, stable and pithy tree
 which are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 like the trunk
 which is impermanent and liable to alteration
 the branches and foliage
 which are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 and like the shade
 which is impermanent and liable to alteration.

 If anyone, sisters, were to speak thus: 'The roots of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 the trunk of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 the branches and foliage of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 but that which is its shade
 — that is permanent, lasting, eternal,
 not liable to alteration,
 speaking thus, sisters,
 would he be speaking rightly?'

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is, revered sir, that if the roots of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 the trunk of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 the foliage and branches of this great, stable and pithy tree
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 all the more is the shade impermanent and liable to alteration."

 "Even so, sisters,
 if anyone should speak thus:
 'These six external sense-fields
 are impermanent and liable to alteration,
 but whatever pleasure or pain
 or neither pain nor pleasure
 is experience as a result of these six external sense-fields
 — that is permanent, lasting, eternal,
 not liable to alteration,'
 speaking thus, sisters,
 would he be speaking rightly?"

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 As a result of this or that condition, revered sir,
 these or those feeling arise.
 From the stopping of this or that condition
 these or those feelings are stopped."

 "It is good, sisters, it is good.

 For it is thus, sisters,
 that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this is seen by an Ariyan disciple as it really is.

 It is, sisters, as if a clever cattle-butcher
 or cattle-butcher's apprentice,
 having killed a cow,
 should dissect the cow with a butcher's sharp knife
 without spoiling the flesh within,
 without spoiling the outer hide,
 and with the butcher's sharp knife
 should cut,
 should cut around,
 should cut all around
 whatever tendons, sinews and ligaments there are there within;
 and having cut,
 cut around,
 cut all around
 and removed the outer hide and,
 having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,
 should then speak thus:
 'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'

 Speaking thus, sisters, would he be speaking rightly?"

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 Although, revered sir, that clever cattle-butcher
 or cattle-butcher's apprentice,
 having killed a cow
 should dissect the cow with a butcher's sharp knife
 without spoiling the flesh within,
 without spoiling the outer hide,
 and with the butcher's sharp knife
 should cut,
 should cut around,
 should cut all around
 whatever tendons, sinews and ligaments there are there within;
 and having cut,
 cut around,
 cut all around
 and removed the outer hide and,
 having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,
 should then speak thus:
 'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'
 yet that cow is not conjoined with that hide."

 "I have made this simile for you, sisters,
 so as to illustrate the meaning.

 This is the meaning here:

 'The flesh within,' sisters,
 is a synonym for the six internal sense-fields.
 'The outer hide,' sisters,
 is a synonym for the six external sense-fields.

 'The tendons, sinews and ligaments within,' sisters,
 is a synonym for delight and attachment.

 'The butcher's sharp knife,' sisters,
 is a synonym for the Ariyan intuitive wisdom,
 the Ariyan intuitive wisdom by which one cuts,
 cuts around
 and cuts all around
 the inner defilement's
 the inner fetters
 and the inner bonds.

 There are, sisters, these seven links in awakening
 from the development and making much of which a monk,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having here and now realized
 by his own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 entering on them abides therein.

 What are the seven?

 Herein, sisters, a monk develops the link in awakening
 that is mindfulness
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is investigation into things
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is energy
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is rapture
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is impassability
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is concentration
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependant on detachment,
 dependant on cessation,
 ending in abandoning;

 he develops the link in awakening
 that is equanimity
 and is dependent on aloofness,
 dependent on detachment,
 dependent on cessation,
 ending in abandoning.

 These, sisters, are the seven links in awakening
 from the development and making much of which a monk,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having here and now realized
 by his own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 entering on them abides therein.

 Then the venerable Nandaka,
 having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation,
 dismissed them, saying:

 "Go, sisters, it is time."

 Then these nuns,
 having rejoiced in what the venerable Nandaka had said
 and having given thanks,
 rose from their seats,
 greeted the venerable Nandaka
 keeping their right sides towards him,
 and approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 they stood at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus to these nuns
 as they were standing at a respectful distance:

 "Go, nuns, it is time."

 Then these nuns,
 having greeted the Lord,
 departed keeping their right sides towards him.
 Not long after these nuns had departed
 the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks, as on an Observance day,
 a fifteenth,
 there is neither doubt nor perplexity among the populace
 as to whether the moon is not full
 or whether the moon is full,
 for the moon is then quite full,
 even so, monks, these nuns were delighted with Nandaka's teaching on Dhamma
 and their aspirations were fulfilled.

 She who is the last nun[8] of these five hundred nuns is a stream-attainer,
 not liable to the Downfall;
 she is assured, bound for self-awakening."

 Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
