# 116. Discourse at Isigili

## Isigili Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 on Isigili mountain.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Do not you, monks, see this Vebhāra[1] mountain?"

 "Yes, revered sir."
 [111] "There was another designation, monks, of this Vebhāra mountain,
 another name.

 Do not you, monks, see this Paṇḍava mountain?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "There was another designation, monks,
 of this Paṇḍava mountain,
 another name.

 Do not you, monks, see this Vepulla mountain?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "There was another designation, monks,
 of this Vepulla mountain,[2] another name.

 Do not you, monks, see this Gijjhakūṭa mountain?"[3]

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "There was another designation, monks,
 of this Gijjhakūṭa mountain,
 another name.

 Do not you, monks, see this Isigili mountain?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "This has always been the designation, monks,
 this always the name
 of this Isigili mountain.

 Once upon a time, monks,
 five hundred paccekabuddhas[4]
 dwelt for a long time
 on this Isigili mountain.

 They were seen
 as they were entering this mountain,
 but once they had entered
 they were not seen.

 People seeing this, spoke thus;

 'This mountain swallows these seers' (isī gilati);[5]
 so did Isigili receive the very designation Isigili.

 I will point out to you, monks,
 the names of the paccekabuddhas;
 I will relate, monks,
 the names of the paccekabuddhas;
 I will tell, monks,
 the names of the paccekabuddhas.

 Listen, attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Ariṭṭha,[6] monks,
