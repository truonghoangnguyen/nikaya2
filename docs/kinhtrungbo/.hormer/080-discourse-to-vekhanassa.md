# 80. Discourse to Vekhanassa

## Vekhanassa Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapinḍika's monastery.

 Then the wanderer Vekhanassa[1] approached the Lord;
 having approached, [237] he greeted the Lord;
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he stood at a respectful distance.

 As he was standing at a respectful distance,
 the wanderer Vekhanassa uttered a solemn utterance
 in the Lord's presence:

 "This is the highest lustre,
 this is the highest lustre."
 "But why do you, Kaccāna,[2] speak thus:

 'This is the highest lustre,
 this is the highest lustre?'

 Which is this highest lustre?"

 "Good Gotama, there is no other lustre
 superior to
 or more excellent than this lustre,
 it is the highest lustre."

 "But which, Kaccāna,
 is this lustre
 than which there is no other lustre
 superior or more excellent?"

 "Good Gotama, there is no other lustre
 superior to
 or more excellent than this lustre,
 it is the highest lustre."

 "You would be long in expanding this, Kaccāna.

 You say:

 'Good Gotama, there is no other lustre
 superior to
 or more excellent than this lustre,
 it is the highest lustre.'

 But you do not point to this lustre.

 Kaccāna, it is as though a man should say:

 'Whoever is the belle of this countryside,
 I want her,
 I desire her.'[3]

 Another man might say to him:

 'My good man,
 do you know whether this belle of the countryside
 whom you want and desire
 is a noble maiden
 or a brahmin
 or a merchant
 or a worker?'

 Asked this, he would say:

 'No.'

 The other might say to him:

 'My good man,
 do you know the name
 or the clan
 of this belle of the countryside
 whom you want and desire?'

 Asked this, he would say:

 'No.'

 The other might say to him:

 'My good man,
 do you know whether she is tall
 or short
 or of medium height,
 or dark
 or brown
 or sallow;
 or what village
 or market town
 or what town
 she belongs to?'

 Asked this, he might say:

 'No.'

 The other might speak to him thus:

 'My good man,
 do you want and desire
 her whom you know not,
 see not?'

 Asked this, he might say:

 'Yes.'

 What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 This being so,
 surely that man's irresponsible talk
 does not prosper him?"

 "Certainly, revered sir,
 this being so,
 that man's irresponsible talk
 does not prosper him."

 "But even so do you, Kaccāna, say:

 'Revered sir, there is no other lustre
 superior to
 or more excellent than this lustre,
 it is the highest lustre.'
 But you do not point to this lustre."

 "Revered sir, as an emerald jewel,
 of lovely water,
 well cut into eight facets,
 if placed on a pale piece of cloth
 shines and gleams and glows  of such a lustre
 is the hale self
 after dying."

 "What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 Of these two lustres,
 which is the surpassing and more excellent:
 that emerald jewel,
 of lovely water,
 cut into eight facets
 that, if placed on a pale piece of cloth
 shines and gleams and glows;
 or some glow-worm
 or fire-fly
 in the dense darkness of the night?"

 "Why, revered sir, of these two lustres,
 the surpassing and more excellent
 is the glow-worm
 or fire-fly
 in the dense darkness of the night."

 "What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 Of these two lustres,
 which is the surpassing and more excellent:
 the glow-worm
 or fire-fly
 in the dense darkness of the night
 or an oil-lamp
 in the dense darkness of the night?"

 "Why, revered sir, the oil-lamp."

 "What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 Of these two lustres,
 which is the surpassing and more excellent:
 the oil-lamp
 in the dense darkness of the night
 or a great blaze of fire
 in the dense darkness of the night?"

 "Why, revered sir,
 the great blaze of fire
 in the dense darkness of the night."

 "What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 Of these two lustres,
 which is the surpassing and more excellent:
 the great blaze of fire
 in the dense darkness of the night
 or the morning star
 in a clear cloudless sky
 towards dawn?"
 "Why, revered sir,
 the morning star
 in a clear cloudless sky
 towards dawn
 is the surpassing and more excellent
 of these two lustres."

 "What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 Of these two lustres,
 which is the surpassing and more excellent:
 the morning star
 in a clear cloudless sky
 towards dawn
 or the moon at its zenith
 in a clear cloudless sky
 at midnight
 on an Observance day,
 a fifteenth?"

 "Why, revered sir,
 on an Observance day,
 a fifteenth,
 the moon at its zenith
 in a clear cloudless sky
 at midnight."

 "What do you think about this, Kaccāna?

 Of these two lustres,
 which is the surpassing and more excellent:
 the moon at its zenith
 in a clear cloudless sky
 at midnight
 on an Observance day,
 a fifteenth,
 or the sun at its zenith
 in a clear cloudless sky
 at noonday
 in the last month of the rains
 in the autumn?"

 "Why, revered sir,
 the sun at its zenith
 in a clear cloudless sky
 at noonday
 in the last month of the rains
 in the autumn
 is of these two lustres
 the surpassing and more excellent."

 "Greater than these
 are those many devas, Kaccāna,
 who do not share in the brilliance
 of these moons and suns  that I comprehend.

 But then I do not say:

 'There is no other lustre
 superior to
 or more excellent than this lustre.'

 But you, Kaccāna,
 although this lustre of a glow-worm
 or a fire-fly
 is feebler and poorer,
 say it is the highest lustre.

 And you do not point to that lustre.
 These five, Kaccāna,
 are the strands of sense-pleasures.[4]

 Which five?

 Material shapes cognisable by the eye,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 Sounds cognisable by the ear,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 Smells cognisable by the nose,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 Tastes cognisable by the tongue,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 Touches cognisable by the body,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 These, Kaccana, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.

 Whatever happiness, Kaccāna,
 whatever pleasure
 arises in consequence
 of these five strands of sense-pleasure,
 this is called happiness in sense-pleasures.

 Thus, because of sense-pleasures
 there is happiness in sense-pleasures;
 from happiness in sense-pleasures
 the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures[5]
 is there accounted topmost."

 When this had been said,
 the wanderer Vekhanassa spoke thus to [238] the Lord:

 "It is wonderful, good Gotama,
 it is marvellous, good Gotama.

 So far this is well spoken by the good Gotama:

 'Because of sense-pleasures
 there is happiness in sense-pleasures;
 from happiness in sense-pleasures
 the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures
 is there accounted topmost.'"

 "Hard is this for you to understand, Kaccāna  sense-pleasures,
 or the happiness in sense-pleasures,
 or the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures  you who are of another view,
 another allegiance,
 another objective,
 of a different observance
 and under a different teacher.[6]

 But those monks, Kaccāna, who are perfected ones,
 the cankers destroyed,
 who have lived the life,
 done what was to be done,
 shed the burden,
 who have attained their own goal,
 the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,
 and who are freed
 by perfect profound knowledge  these would know:
 sense-pleasures,
 or the happiness in sense-pleasures,
 or the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures."

 When this had been said,
 the wanderer Vekhanassa,
 angry and displeased,
 scorning even the Lord,
 despising even him,
 saying[7] even of him:

 "The recluse Gotama shall be disgraced,"
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "But it is just that there are here
 some recluses and brahmans
 who, not knowing the past,
 not seeing the future,
 yet claim:

 'Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'

 This speech of theirs
 proves merely ridiculous,
 worthless,
 empty,
 void."[8]

 "This censure is only just, Kaccāna,
 for those recluses and brahmans
 who, not knowing the past,
 not seeing the future,
 yet claim:

 'Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'

 But, Kaccāna,
 let be the past,
 let be the future.[9]

 Let there come an intelligent man,
 guileless,
 honest,
 straight,
 and who says:

 'I instruct,
 I teach dhamma.[10]

 Faring along as instructed
 it will not be long before (some man)
 of himself will know,
 of himself will see.'

 Even so, indeed,
 is deliverance from the direst bond  that is from the bond of ignorance.

 Kaccāna, it is like a young baby boy
 lying on his [239] back
 and bound around his neck
 with a fivefold swaddling,
 it might be with swaddlings of thread.

 As he grows up
 and develops his faculties
 he would be released from those swaddlings,
 and in the absence of swaddlings
 he would know:

 'I am released.'

 Even so, Kaccāna,
 let there come intelligent man,
 guileless,
 honest,
 straight,
 and who says:

 'I instruct, I teach dhamma.
 Faring along as instructed
 it will not be long before (some man)
 of himself will know,
 of himself will see.'

 Even so, indeed,
 is deliverance from the direst bond  that is from the bond of ignorance."

 When this had been said,
 the wanderer Vekhanassa spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is excellent, good Gotama,
 excellent, good Gotama.

 Revered sir, it is as if one might set upright
 what had been upset,
 or might disclose what was covered,
 or show the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision
 might see material shapes —
 even so in many a figure
 has dhamma been made clear by the Lord.

 I, revered sir, am going to the Lord for refuge
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the Lord accept me as a lay follower
 going for refuge
 from this day forth
 for as long as life lasts."
