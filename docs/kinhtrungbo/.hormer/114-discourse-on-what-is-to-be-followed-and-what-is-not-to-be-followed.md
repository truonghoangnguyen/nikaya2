# 114. Discourse on What is to Be Followed and What is Not to Be Followed

## Sevitabba-Asevitabba Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I will teach you a disquisition on dhamma
 regarding what is to be followed
 and what is not to be followed.
 Listen to it,
 pay careful attention
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.

 And I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.

 And I, monks, say that mental conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in mental conduct.

 And I, monks, say that the arising of thought is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in the arising of thought.

 And I, monks, say that the assumption of perception is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in the assumption of perception.

 And I, monks, say that the assumption of views is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in the assumption of views.

 And I, monks, say that the assumption of individuality[1] is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be [95] followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in the assumption of individuality.

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:

 "I, revered sir, thus understand this to be the meaning in full
 of what was spoken of by the Lord in brief,
 but of which the meaning was not explained in full:

 'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.'

 This was said by the Lord.

 In reference to what was it said?

 Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed
 and unskilled states of mind grow much,
 skilled states of mind decrease,
 this kind of bodily conduct is not to be followed.

 Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed
 and unskilled states of mind decrease,
 skilled states of mind grow much,
 this kind of bodily conduct is to be followed.

 And what kind of bodily conduct, revered sir,
 does a man follow
 that unskilled states of mind grow much in him,
 skilled states of mind decrease?

 As to this,[2] revered sir,
 someone makes onslaught on creatures,
 he is cruel,
 bloody-handed,
 intent on injuring and killing,
 without mercy to living creatures.

 He is a taker of what is not given;
 whatever property of another
 in village or jungle
 is not given to him
 he takes by theft.

 He is a wrong-goer in regard to pleasures of the senses;
 he has intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,
 he has intercourse with (girls) protected by the father,
 he has intercourse with (girls) protected by the parents,
 he has intercourse with (girls) protected by a brother,
 he has intercourse with (girls) protected by a sister,
 he has intercourse with (girls) protected by relations,
 he has intercourse with (girls) who have a husband,
 and whose use involves punishments,
 and even with those adorned with the garlands of betrothal.

 If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,
 unskilled states of mind grow much,
 skilled states of mind decrease.
 And what kind of bodily conduct, revered sir,
 does a man follow
 that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,
 skilled states of mind grow much?

 As to this, revered sir,
 someone, abandoning onslaught on creatures,
 is restrained from onslaught on creatures;
 the stick laid aside,
 the sword laid aside,
 he lives scrupulous,
 merciful,
 kindly and compassionate
 to all living creatures.

 Abandoning taking what is not given,
 he is restrained from taking what is not given;
 he does not take by theft
 any property of another
 in village or jungle
 that is not given to him.

 Abandoning wrong-going in [96] regard to pleasures of the senses,
 he is restrained from wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses;
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the father,
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the parents,
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by a brother,
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by a sister,
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by relations,
 he does not have intercourse with (girls) who have a husband,
 nor whose use involves punishments,
 nor even with those adorned with the garlands of betrothal.

 If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,
 unskilled states of mind decrease,
 skilled states of mind grow much.

 When the Lord said:

 'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in bodily conduct,'
 it was said in reference to this.

 ■

 'I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.'

 This was said by the Lord.

 In reference to what was it said?

 Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed
 and unskilled states of mind grow much,
 skilled states of mind decrease,
 this kind of vocal conduct is not to be followed.

 Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed
 and unskilled states of mind decrease,
 skilled states of mind grow much,
 this kind of vocal conduct is to be followed.

 And what land of vocal conduct, revered sir,
 does a man follow
 that unskilled states of mind grow much in him,
 skilled states of mind decrease?
 As to this, revered sir,
 someone is of lying speech;
 when he is cited and questioned as a witness
 before a council or a company
 or amid his relations
 or amid a guild
 or a royal family,
 and is told:

 'Now, my good man,
 say what you know,'

 although he does not know, he says,
 'I know,'
 and although he knows, he says,
 'I do not know ;
 although he has not seen, he says,
 'I saw,'
 and although he has seen, he says,
 'I did not see.'

 Thus his speech becomes intentional lying
 either for his own sake
 or for that of another
 or for the sake of some material gain or other.

 And he is a slanderer;
 having heard something at one place,
 he makes it known elsewhere
 for causing variance among those people;
 or having heard something elsewhere
 he makes it known among these people
 for causing variance among them.

 In this way he sows discord among those who were in harmony
 or foments those who are at variance.
 Discord is his pleasure,
 his delight,
 his joy,
 the motive of his speech.

 And he is one of harsh speech.

 Whatever speech is rough,
 hard,
 severe on others,
 abusive of others,
 bordering on wrath,
 not conducive to concentration,
 such speech does he utter.

 And he is a frivolous chatterer,
 one who speaks at a wrong time,
 not in accordance with fact,
 one who speaks about what is not the goal,
 about non-dhamma,
 about non-discipline.

 He utters speech that is not [97] worth treasuring;
 owing to its being at the wrong time
 it is incongruous,
 has no purpose,
 is not connected with the goal.

 If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,
 unskilled states of mind grow much,
 skilled states of mind decrease.

 And what kind of vocal conduct, revered sir,
 does a man follow
 that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,
 skilled states of mind grow much?
 As to this, revered sir, someone,
 abandoning lying speech
 is restrained from lying speech.

 When he is cited and questioned as a witness
 before a council
 or company
 or amid his relations
 or amid a guild
 or a royal family,
 and is told:

 'Now, my good man,
 say what you know,'

 if he does not know he says,
 'I do not know,'
 and if he knows he says,
 'I know ;
 if he has not seen, he says,
 'I did not see,'
 and if he has seen, he says,
 'I saw.'

 Thus his speech is not intentional lying
 either for his own sake
 or for that of another
 or for the sake of some material gain or other.

 Abandoning slanderous speech,
 he is restrained from slanderous speech.

 Having heard something at one place,
 he is not one to repeat it elsewhere
 for causing variance among those people;
 or having heard something elsewhere
 he is not one to repeat it among these people
 for causing variance among them.

 In this way
 he is a reconciler of those who are at variance
 and one who combines those who are friends.

 Concord is his pleasure,
 his delight,
 his joy,
 the motive of his speech.

 Abandoning harsh speech,
 he is restrained from harsh speech.

 Whatever speech is gentle,
 pleasing to the ear,
 affectionate,
 going to the heart,
 urbane,
 pleasant to the manyfolk,
 agreeable to the manyfolk  such speech does he utter.

 Abandoning frivolous chatter,
 he is restrained from frivolous chatter.

 He is one that speaks at a right time,
 in accordance with fact,
 about the goal,
 about dhamma,
 about discipline.

 He utters speech that is worth treasuring,
 with opportune similes,
 purposeful,
 connected with the goal.
 If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,
 unskilled states of mind decrease,
 skilled states of mind grow much.

 When the Lord said:

 'I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;
 and there is this disparity in vocal conduct,'
 it was said in reference to this.

 ■

 'I, monks, say that mental conduct is of two kinds,
 one of which is to be followed
 and the other which is not to be followed;

 This was said by the Lord.

 and unskilled states of mind grow much, [98]
 skilled states of mind decrease,
 this kind of mental conduct is not to be followed.

 And what kind of mental conduct, revered sir,
 does a man follow

 skilled states of mind decrease?
 As to this, revered sir,
 someone is covetous;
 he covets that which is the property of another,
 thinking:

 '0 might that which is the other's be mine';

 he is malevolent in thought,
 corrupt in mind and purpose,
 and thinks:

 'Let these beings be killed
 or slaughtered
 or annihilated
 or destroyed,
 or may they not exist at all.'

 If this kind of mental conduct is followed, revered sir,
 unskilled states of mind grow much,
 skilled states of mind decrease.

 but thinks:
 'Let these beings,
 free from enmity,
 peaceable,
 secure and happy,
 look after self.'

 If this kind of mental conduct is followed, revered sir,
 unskilled states of mind decrease,
 skilled states of mind grow much.

 When the Lord said:

 And what land of vocal conduct, Sāriputta,

 As to this, Sāriputta,
 someone is of lying speech;
 when he is cited and questioned as a witness
 before a council or a company
 or amid his relations
 or amid a guild
 or a royal family,
 and is told:

 'Now, my good man,
 say what you know,'
 although he does not know, he says,
 'I know,'
 and although he knows, he says,
 'I do not know ;
 although he has not seen, he says,
 'I saw,'
 and although he has seen, he says,
 'I did not see.'

 Thus his speech becomes intentional lying
 either for his own sake
 or for that of another
 or for the sake of some material gain or other.

 And he is a slanderer;
 having heard something at one place,
 he makes it known elsewhere
 for causing variance among those people;
 or having heard something elsewhere

 He utters speech that is not worth treasuring;
 owing to its being at the wrong time
 it is incongruous,
 has no purpose,
 is not connected with the goal.

 As to this, Sāriputta, someone,
 abandoning lying speech
 is restrained from lying speech.

 When he is cited and questioned as a witness
 before a council

 and is told:
 'Now, my good man,
 say what you know,'

 if he does not know he says,
 'I do not know,'
 and if he knows he says,
 'I know ;
 if he has not seen, he says,
 'I did not see,'
 and if he has seen, he says,
 'I saw.'

 Thus his speech is not intentional lying
 either for his own sake
 or for that of another
 or for the sake of some material gain or other.

 Abandoning slanderous speech,
 he is restrained from slanderous speech.

 Having heard something at one place,
 he is not one to repeat it elsewhere
 for causing variance among those people;
 or having heard something elsewhere
 he is not one to repeat it among these people
 for causing variance among them.

 he is a reconciler of those who are at variance
 and one who combines those who are friends.

 'I, monks, say that mental conduct is of two kinds,

 and thinks:
 'Let these beings be killed

 free from enmity,
 peaceable,
 secure and happy,
 look after self.'
