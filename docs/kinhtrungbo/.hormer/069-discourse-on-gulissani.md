# 69. Discourse on Gulissāni

## Gulissāni Sutta

#### [469] [141]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove
 at the squirrels' feeding place.

 At that time a monk named Gulissāni,
 forest-gone,
 uncouth in his habits,
 had arrived in the midst of an Order
 on some business or other.

 Thereupon the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks
 concerning the monk Gulissāni,
 saying:
 "Your reverences, a monk who is forest-gone
 and who comes back to an Order
 and is staying with an Order,
 should be deferential
 and respectful
 towards his fellow Brahma-farers.

 If, your reverences,
 a monk who is forest-gone
 comes back to an Order
 and is staying with an Order,
 and is not deferential
 and respectful
 towards his fellow Brahma-farers,
 there will be those who speak about him and say:

 'What is the good of this venerable one
 who is forest-gone
 and who lives alone in the forest
 doing as he pleases
 but who is not deferential
 and respectful
 towards his fellow Brahma-farers?
 there will be those who speak about him.

 and who has come back to an Order
 and is staying with [142] an Order
 should bo deferential
 and respectful

 Your reverences, a monk who is forest-gone
 and who comes back to an Order

 not encroaching on[1]

 monks who are elders,
 nor will I keep newly ordained monks from a seat.'[2]

 If, your reverences,
 a monk who is forest-gone
 comes back to an Order

 doing what he pleases
