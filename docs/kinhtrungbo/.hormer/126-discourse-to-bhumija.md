# 126. Discourse to Bhūmija

## Bhūmija Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.

 Then the venerable Bhūmija,[1] having dressed early in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 approached Prince Jayasena's abode;

 [184] having approached,
 he sat down on the appointed seat.

 And Prince Jayasena approached the venerable Bhūmija;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Bhūmija;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the venerable Bhūmija:

 "There are, good Bhūmija, some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of these views:

 'If one fares the Brahma-faring
 with an expectation,[2]
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if one fares the Brahma-faring
 without an expectation,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if one fares the Brahma-faring
 both with an expectation and without,[3]
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if one fares the Brahma-faring
 neither with an expectation nor without,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.'

 What does the good Bhūmija's teacher say about this,
 what does he point out?"

 "I have not heard this face to face with the Lord, Prince,
 nor have I learnt it face to face.

 But the situation exists
 that the Lord might explain it thus:

 If, with an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.
 And if, without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if, both with an expectation and without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if, neither with an expectation nor without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 ■

 But if, with an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 But if, without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 But if, both with an expectation and without,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 But if, neither with an expectation nor without,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 I have not heard this face to face with the Lord, Prince,
 I have not learnt it face to face.

 But the situation exists
 that the Lord might explain it thus."
 "If the good Bhūmija's teacher speaks thus,
 points out thus,
 it seems to me that the good Bhūmija's teacher
 stands head and shoulders above[4]
 all ordinary recluses and brahmans."

 Then Prince Jayasena offered the venerable Bhūmija
 his own (dish of) rice cooked in milk.

 Then the venerable Bhūmija,
 returning from alms-gathering after [185] the meal,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Bhūmija spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Now, revered sir, I,
 having dressed early in the morning[5],
 taking bowl and robe,
 approached Prince Jayasena's abode;
 having approached,
 I sat down on the appointed seat.

 And Prince Jayasena approached me;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with me;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Prince Jayasena spoke thus to me:

 "There are, good Bhūmija, some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of these views:

 'If one fares the Brahma-faring
 with an expectation,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if one fares the Brahma-faring
 without an expectation,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if one fares the Brahma-faring
 both with an expectation and without,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if one fares the Brahma-faring
 neither with an expectation nor without,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.'

 What does the good Bhūmija's teacher say about this,
 what does he point out?"

 "I have not heard this face to face with the Lord, Prince,
 nor have I learnt it face to face.

 But the situation exists
 that the Lord might explain it thus:

 If, with an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.
 And if, without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if, both with an expectation and without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if, neither with an expectation nor without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring inattentively,
 one is incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 ■

 But if, with an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 But if, without an expectation,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 But if, both with an expectation and without,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 But if, neither with an expectation nor without,
 one fares the Brahma-faring attentively,
 one is capable of obtaining the fruit.

 I have not heard this face to face with the Lord, Prince,
 I have not learnt it face to face.

 But the situation exists
 that the Lord might explain it thus."
 "If the good Bhūmija's teacher speaks thus,
 points out thus,
 it seems to me that the good Bhūmija's teacher
 stands head and shoulders above
 all ordinary recluses and brahmans."

 I hope, revered sir,
 that when questioned thus
 and answering thus,
 I was asserting (fairly) what the Lord affirms,
 that I was not misrepresenting the Lord
 with what is not fact,
 but was explaining a dhamma
 that conforms to dhamma
 and that no fellow dhamma-man,
 a holder of (my) views,
 comes to a position incurring blame?"[6]

 "Indeed, Bhūmija, when questioned thus
 and answering thus,
 you were asserting (fairly) what I[7] affirm,
 you were not misrepresenting me
 with what is not fact,
 you were explaining a dhamma
 that conforms to dhamma
 and no fellow dhamma-man,
 a holder of (your) views,
 comes to a position incurring blame.

 If, Bhūmija, those recluses or brahmans
 who are of wrong view,
 wrong aspiration,
 wrong speech,
 wrong action,
 wrong mode of livelihood,
 wrong endeavour,
 wrong mindfulness,
 wrong concentration,
 fare the Brahma-faring with an expectation,
 they are incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if they fare the Brahma-faring without an expectation
 they are incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if they fare the Brahma-faring both with an expectation and without
 they are incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 And if they fare the Brahma-faring neither with an expectation nor without,
 they are incapable of obtaining the fruit.

 What is the reason for this?

 This is not the method,[8] Bhūmija,
 for obtaining the fruit.
