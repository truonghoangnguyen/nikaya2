# 78. Discourse to Samaṇamaṇḍikā's Son

## Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta

#### The Middle Length Sayings

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna, Samaṇamaṇḍikā's son,
 was staying in the One Hall,
 set round with a row of tinduka trees,[1]
 in Malhkā's park
 which was intended for discussion,[2]
 together with a company of wanderers
 numbering at least three hundred.[3]

 Then early one morning the carpenter Pancakaṅga left Sāvatthī
 so as to see the Lord.
 Then it occurred to Pancakaṅga the carpenter:

 "It is not yet the right time to see the Lord.

 The Lord has withdrawn.

 Nor is it the season
 to see the monks who are developing their minds.[4]

 The monks who are developing their minds
 have withdrawn.

 Suppose that I were to approach Mallikā's park,
 which is intended for discussion,
 the One Hall,
 set round with a row of tinduka trees,
 and Uggāhamāna the wanderer, Samaṇamaṇḍikā's son?"[5]

 Then [223] Pancakaṅga the carpenter approached Mallikā's park,
 which is intended for discussion,
 the One Hall,
 set round with a row of tinduka trees,
 and Uggāhamāna the wanderer, Samaṇamaṇḍikā's son.

 At that time Uggāhamāna was sitting down
 with a great company of wanderers
 shouting out with a loud noise,
 a great noise,[6]
 talking various kinds of inferior talk
 that is to say
 talk on kings,
 thieves,
 great ministers,
 armies,
 fears,
 battles,
 food,
 drink,
 clothes,
 beds,
 garlands,
 scents,
 relations,
 vehicles,
 villages,
 market towns,
 towns,
 the country,
 women,
 heroes,
 streets,
 wells,
 those departed before,
 talk of diversity,
 speculation about the world,
 speculation about the sea,
 talk about becoming or not becoming
 thus or thus.

 Uggāhamāna saw the carpenter Pancakaṅga coming in the distance;
 seeing him,
 he called his own company to order,
 saying;

 "Good sirs, let there be little noise;
 do not, good sirs, make a noise;
 this is a disciple of the recluse Gotama who is coming  the carpenter Pancakaṅga.

 For as long as white-frocked householders,
 disciples of the recluse Gotama,
 have been staying at Sāvatthī,
 the carpenter Pancakaṅga has been among them.

 These venerable ones wish for little noise,
 they are trained to little noise,
 they are praisers of little noise.

 So, if he knows that this is a company of little noise,
 he may consider approaching."

 Then these wanderers fell silent.

 Then Pancakaṅga the carpenter
 approached Uggāhamāna;
 having approached
 he exchanged greetings with Uggāhamāna;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 Uggāhamāna spoke thus to Pancakaṅga the carpenter
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "I, carpenter, lay down
 that an individual who is endowed with four qualities
 is abounding in skill,
 of the highest skill,
 an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments.

 With what four?

 As to this, carpenter,
 he does no evil deed with his body,
 he speaks no evil speech,
 he intends no evil intention,
 he leads no evil mode of livelihood.
 I lay down, carpenter,
 that if an individual is endowed with these four qualities
 he is abounding in skill,
 of the highest skill,
 an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments."

 But the carpenter Pancakaṅga
 neither rejoiced in what Uggāhamāna had said
 nor scoffed.

 Neither rejoicing nor scoffing,
 rising from his seat,
 he departed,
 thinking:

 "I will discover the meaning of what was said
 in the Lord's presence."

 Then Pancakaṅga the carpenter
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he ivas sitting down at a respectful distance
 Pancakaṅga the carpenter told the Lord
 the whole of the conversation he had had with Uggāhamāna.

 This said, the Lord spoke thus to Pancakaṅga the carpenter:

 "This being so, carpenter,
 then according to the speech of Uggāhamāna
 a young baby boy
 lying on its back[7] would be of [224] abounding skill,
 of the highest skill,
 an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments.

 For, carpenter,
 a young baby boy lying on its back
 does not think of its own body.[8]

 How then could it do an evil deed with its body,
 except for a little kicking about?

 A young baby boy, carpenter,
 lying on its back
 does not think of its own voice.

 How then could it utter an evil speech,
 except for a little crying?

 A young baby boy, carpenter,
 lying on its back
 does not think about its own intention.

 How then could it intend an evil intention,
 except for a little excitement?[9]

 A young baby boy, carpenter,
 lying on its back
 does not think of its own mode of livelihood.

 How then could it lead an evil mode of livelihood,
 except for taking its mother's milk?

 This being so, carpenter,
 then according to the speech of Uggāhamāna
 a young baby boy lying on its back
 would be of abounding skill,
 of the highest skill,
 an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments.

 Now I, carpenter, lay down
 that an individual,
 endowed with four qualities,
 is neither of abounding skill
 nor of the highest skill
 nor is he an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments;
 and that these moreover
 merely distinguish[10]
 a young baby boy lying on its back.

 With what four?

 As to this, carpenter,
 he does no evil deed with his body,
 he utters no evil speech,
 he intends no evil intention,
 he leads no evil mode of livelihood.

 I, carpenter, lay down
 that if an individual is endowed
 with these four qualities
 he is neither abounding in skill,
 nor of the highest skill,
 nor an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments;
 and that these moreover
 merely distinguish
 a young baby boy lying on its back.

 I, carpenter, lay down
 that an individual,
 endowed with ten qualities,
 is abounding in skill,
 of the highest skill,
 an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments.

 I say it is to be understood for him,[11] carpenter,
 that these[12] are unskilled moral habits.

 I say it is to be understood for him, carpenter,
 that hence-originating
 are unskilled moral habits.

 I say it is to be understood for him, carpenter,
 that here unskilled moral habits
 are stopped without remainder.

 I say it is to be understood for him, carpenter,
 that [225] faring along thus,
 he is faring along
 for the stopping of unskilled moral habits.

 And which, carpenter, are the unskilled moral habits?

 Unskilled deed of body,
 unskilled deed of speech,
 evil mode of livelihood  these, carpenter, are called
 unskilled moral habits.

 And how, carpenter,
 do these unskilled moral habits originate?

 Their origination is spoken of too.

 It should be answered that
 the origination is in the mind.[13]

 Which mind?

 For the mind is manifold,
 various,
 diverse.

 That mind[14] which has attachment,
 aversion,
 confusion  originating from this
 are unskilled moral habits.

 But where,[15] carpenter,
 are these unskilled moral habits
 stopped without remainder?
 Their stopping is spoken of too.

 As to this, carpenter, a monk,
 getting rid of wrong conduct in body,
 develops right conduct in body;
 getting rid of wrong conduct in speech,
 he develops right conduct in speech;
 getting rid of wrong conduct in thought,
 he develops right conduct in thought;
 getting rid of a wrong mode of livelihood,
 he leads his life with a right mode of livelihood.

 It is thus that these unskilled moral habits
 are stopped without remainder.

 And faring along in what way, carpenter,
 is he faring along
 for the stopping of unskilled moral habits?

 As to this, carpenter,
 a monk generates desire,[16]
 he endeavours,
 stirs up energy,
 exerts his mind
 and strives
 for the non-arising of evil unskilled states of mind
 that have not arisen.

 He generates desire,

 and strives
 for the maintenance,
 preservation,
 increase,
 maturity,
 development
 and completion
 of skilled states of mind that have [226] arisen.

 Faring along thus, carpenter,
 he is faring along
 for the stopping of unskilled moral habits.

 And which, carpenter,
 are the skilled moral habits?

 Skilled deed of body,
 skilled deed of speech;
 and I, carpenter, say
 that included in moral habit
 is entire purity of mode of livelihood.

 These, carpenter, are called
 skilled moral habits.
 And how, carpenter,
 do these skilled moral habits originate?

 Their origination is spoken of too.

 It should be answered that
 the origination is in the mind.

 Which mind?

 For the mind is manifold,
 various,

 That mind which is devoid of attachment,
 devoid of aversion,
 devoid of confusion  originating from this
 are the skilled moral habits.

 And where, carpenter,
 are these skilled moral habits
 stopped without remainder?

 Their stopping is spoken of too.

 As to this, carpenter,
 a monk is of moral habit
 and has no addition to make to moral habit,[17]
 and he comprehends that freedom of mind,
 that freedom through intuitive wisdom
 as they really are.

 Herein[18] are these skilled moral habits of his
 stopped without remainder.
 And faring along in what way, carpenter,
 is he faring along
 for the stopping of skilled moral habits?

 As to this, carpenter,

 he is faring along
 for the stopping of skilled moral habits.

 And which, carpenter, are unskilled intentions?

 Intention for sense-pleasures,
 intention for malevolence,
 intention for harming.

 These, carpenter, are called
 unskilled intentions.

 And how, carpenter, do these unskilled intentions originate?

 Their origination is spoken of too.

 It should be answered
 that their origination is in perception.

 Which perception?

 For perception is many,
 various,
 diverse:
 perception of sense-pleasures,
 perception of malevolence,
 perception of harming  originating from these
 are unskilled intentions.
 But where, carpenter,
 are these unskilled intentions
 stopped without remainder?

 Their stopping is spoken of too.

 As to this, carpenter, a monk,
 aloof from the pleasures of the [227] senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 entering into the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful,
 abides in it.

 Herein are these unskilled intentions
 stopped without remainder.

 And faring along in what way, carpenter,
 is he faring along
 for the stopping of unskilled intentions?

 he is faring along
 for the stopping of unskilled intentions.

 And which, carpenter, are skilled intentions?

 Intention for renunciation,

 intention for nonharming.

 These, carpenter, are called
 skilled intentions.
 And how, carpenter,
 do these skilled intentions originate?

 Their origination is spoken of too.

 It should be answered
 that their origination is in perception.

 Which perception?

 For perception is many,
 various,
 diverse:
 perception of renunciation,
 perception of non-malevolence,
 perception of non-harming  originating from these
 are skilled intentions.

 But where, carpenter,
 are these skilled perceptions stopped without remainder?

 Their stopping is spoken of too.

 As to this, carpenter, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 Herein are these skilled intentions
 stopped without remainder.
 And faring along in what way, carpenter,

 Faring along thus, carpenter,
 he is faring along
 for the stopping of skilled intentions.

 And endowed with what ten qualities
 do I, carpenter, lay down
 that an individual is abounding in skill,
 of the highest skill,
 an unconquerable recluse
 attained to the utmost attainments?

 As to this, carpenter,
 a monk is endowed with the perfect view of an adept,
 he is endowed with the perfect intention of an adept,
 he is endowed with the perfect speech of an adept,
 he is endowed with the perfect action of an adept,
 he is endowed with the perfect mode of livelihood of an adept,

 attained to the highest attainments."
 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, Pancakaṅga the carpenter
 rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
