# 137. Discourse on the Analysis of the Sixfold (Sense-) Field

## Saḷāyatana-Vibhaṅga Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I will teach you, monks,
 the analysis of the sixfold (sense-) field.
 Listen to it,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Six internal sense-fields are to be known.

 Six external sense-fields are to be known.

 Six classes of consciousness are to be known.

 Six classes of (sense-)impingement are to be known.

 Eighteen mental ranges[1] are to be known.

 Thirty-six modes for creatures[2] are to be known.

 Wherefore, because of this
 get rid of this.[3]

 There are three arousings of mindfulness[4]
 each of which [264] an ariyan practises
 and, practising which,
 is an ariyan who is a teacher fit to instruct a group.[5]

 Of trainers[6]
 he is called
 the incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed.

 §
 This is the exposition[7] of the analysis
 of the sixfold sense-field:

 When it is said,

 'Six internal sense-fields[8] are to be known,'

 in reference to what is it said?

 To the sense-field of eye,
 the sense-field of ear,
 the sense-field of nose,
 the sense-field of tongue,
 the sense-field of body,
 the sense-field of mind.

 When it is said,

 'Six internal sense-fields are to be known,'

 it is said in reference to this.

 §

 When it is said,

 'Six external sense-fields are to be known,'

 in reference to what is it said?

 To the sense-field of material shape,
 the sense-field of sound,
 the sense-field of smell,
 the sense-field of taste,
 the sense-field of touch,
 the sense-field of mental states.

 When it is said,

 'Six external sense-fields are to be known,'

 it is said in reference to this.

 §

 When it is said,

 'Six classes of consciousness are to be known,'

 in reference to what is it said?

 To visual consciousness,
 auditory consciousness,
 olfactory consciousness,
 gustatory consciousness,
 tactile consciousness,
 mental consciousness.

 When it is said,

 'Six classes of consciousness are to be known,'

 it is said in reference to this.
 §

 When it is said,

 'Six classes of (sense-)impingement[9] are to be known,'

 in reference to what is it said?

 To visual impact,
 auditory impact,
 olfactory impact,
 gustatory impact,
 tactile impact,
 mental impact.

 When it is said,

 'Six classes of (sense-)impingement are to be known,'

 it is said in reference to this.

 §

 [265] When it is said,

 'Eighteen mental ranges[10] are to be known,'

 in reference to what is it said?

 Having seen a material shape with the eye[11]
 one ranges over[12] the material shape
 that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the material shape
 that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the material shape
 that gives rise to equanimity.

 ■

 Having heard a sound with the ear
 one ranges over the sound
 that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the sound
 that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the sound
 that gives rise to equanimity.

 ■

 Having smelt a smell with the nose
 one ranges over the smell
 that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the smell
 that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the smell
 that gives rise to equanimity.

 ■

 Having tasted a flavour with the tongue
 one ranges over the flavour
 that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the flavour
 that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the flavour
 that gives rise to equanimity.

 ■
 Having felt a touch with the body
 one ranges over the touch
 that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the touch
 that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the touch
 that gives rise to equanimity.

 ■

 Having cognised a mental state with the mind
 one ranges over the mental state
 that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the mental state
 that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the mental state
 that gives rise to equanimity.

 In this way there are six ranges for joy,
 six ranges for sorrow,
 six ranges for equanimity.

 When it is said,

 'Eighteen mental ranges are to be known,'

 it is said in reference to this.

 These are the six sorrows connected with renunciation.

 Herein what are the six equanimities
 connected with worldly life?

 When a foolish,
 errant,
 average person
 has seen a material shape with the eye,
 there arises the equanimity
 of an uninstructed average person
 who has not conquered (his defilements),[18]
 who has not conquered fruition,[19]
 who does not see the peril[20] equanimity such as this
 does not go further than material shape.

 Therefore this is called
 equanimity connected with worldly life.[21]

 ■

 When a foolish,

 average person
 has heard a sound with the ear,
 there arises the equanimity

 When one has known the impermanency
 of material shapes themselves,
 their alteration,
 disappearance
 and arrest,

 their alteration,
 disappearance
 and arrest,
 and thinks,

 by means of perfect wisdom,
 equanimity arises.

 Equanimity such as this
 goes further than sounds.
 Therefore it is called
 equanimity connected with renunciation.

 ■

 When one has known the impermanency
 of smells themselves,
 their alteration,
 disappearance
 and arrest,
 and thinks,

 'Formerly as well as now

 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 equanimity arises.

 Equanimity such as this
 goes further than smells.

 Therefore it is called
 equanimity connected with renunciation.

 ■

 When one has known the impermanency
 of [268] flavours themselves,
 their alteration,
 disappearance
 and arrest,
 and thinks,
 'Formerly as well as now
 all these flavours are impermanent,

 liable to alteration,'

 from seeing this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 equanimity arises.

 Equanimity such as this
 goes further than flavours.

 Therefore it is called
 equanimity connected with renunciation.

 ■

 When one has known the impermanency
 of touches themselves,
 their alteration,
 disappearance
 and arrest,
 and thinks,

 'Formerly as well as now
 all these touches are impermanent,

 equanimity arises.

 Equanimity such as this
 goes further than touches.
 Therefore it is called
 equanimity connected with renunciation.

 When one has known the impermanency
 of mental states themselves,
 their alteration,
 disappearance
 and arrest,
 and thinks,

 'Formerly as well as now

 equanimity arises.

 Equanimity such as this
 goes further than mental states.

 Therefore it is called
 equanimity connected with renunciation.

 These are the six equanimities connected with renunciation.

 When it is said,

 'Thirty-six modes for creatures are to be known,'

 it is said in reference to this.
 §

 Herein when it is said,

 'Wherefore, because of this
 get rid of this'

 in reference to what is it said?

 Herein, monks, because of[22]
 and by means of[22] these six joys connected with renunciation,
 get rid of
 and transcend
 those six joys connected with worldly life.

 Thus is the getting rid of these,
 thus is their transcending.[23]

 Herein, monks, because of
 and by means of
 these six equanimities connected with renunciation,
 get rid of
 and transcend
 those six joys connected with renunciation.

 Thus is the getting rid of these,
 thus is their transcending.
 There is, monks, equanimity in face of multiformity,
 connected with multiformity;
 there is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 connected with uniformity.[24]

 And what, monks, is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 connected with multiformity?

 It is, monks,
 equanimity among material shapes,
 equanimity among sounds,
 equanimity among smells,
 equanimity among flavours,
 equanimity among touches.

 This, monks, is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 connected with multiformity.

 And what, monks, is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 connected with uniformity?

 It is, monks, equanimity connected with the plane of infinite ether,
 connected with the plane of infinite consciousness,
 connected with the plane [269] of no-thing,
 connected with the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

 This, monks, is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 connected with uniformity.

 Herein, monks, because of
 and by means of
 this equanimity in face of uniformity,
 connected with uniformity,
 get rid of
 and transcend
 that equanimity in face of multiformity,

 Because of lack of desire,[25] monks,
 by means of lack of desire,
 get rid of
 and transcend
 that equanimity in face of uniformity,
 connected with uniformity.

 Thus is the getting rid of it,
 thus is its transcending.

 When it is said,

 'Wherefore because of this
 get rid of this,'

 it is said in reference to this.

 §

 When it is said,

 'There are three arousings of mindfulness
 each of which an ariyan practises
 and, practising which,
 is an ariyan who is a teacher
 fit to instruct a group,'

 in reference to what is it said?
 As to this,[26] monks,
 a teacher teaches dhamma to disciples,
 compassionate,
 seeking their welfare,
 out of compassion,
 saying:

 'This is for your welfare,
 this is for your happiness.'

 But his disciples do not listen,
 do not lend ear,
 do not prepare their minds for profound knowledge
 and, turning aside,
 move away from the teacher's instruction.

 Herein, monks, the Tathāāgata is neither delighted
 nor does he experience delight,
 but dwells untroubled,[27]
 mindful
 and clearly conscious.

 This, monks, is the first arousing of mindfulness
 that the ariyan practises
 and, practising it,
 is an ariyan who is a teacher
 fit to instruct a group.

 ■

 And again, monks, a teacher teaches dhamma to disciples,
 compassionate,
 seeking their welfare,
 out of compassion,
 saying:
 'This is for your welfare,
 this is for your happiness.'

 Some of his disciples do not listen,
 do not lend ear,
 do not prepare their minds for profound knowledge
 and, turning aside,
 move away from the teacher's instruction.

 But some disciples listen,
 lend ear,
 prepare their minds for profound knowledge
 and, not turning aside,
 do not move away from the teacher's instruction.

 Herein, monks, the Tathāāgata is neither delighted
 nor does he experience delight
 and neither is he depressed
 nor does he experience depression.

 Having ousted both delight and depression,
 he dwells with equanimity,
 mindful and clearly conscious.

 This, monks, is the second arousing of mindfulness
 that the ariyan practises
 and, practising it,
 is an ariyan who is a teacher
 fit to instruct a group.

 [270] And again, monks, a teacher teaches dhamma to disciples,
 compassionate,
 seeking their welfare,
 out of compassion,
 saying:
 'This is for your welfare,
 this is for your happiness.'

 His disciples listen,
 lend ear,
 prepare their minds for profound knowledge
 and, not turning aside,
 do not move from the teacher's instruction.

 Herein, monks, the Tathāgata is delighted
 and he experiences delight
 but he dwells untroubled,[28]
 mindful and clearly conscious.

 This, monks, is the third arousing of mindfulness
 that the ariyan practises
 and, practising it,
 is an ariyan who is a teacher
 fit to instruct a group.

 When it is said:

 'There are three arousings of mindfulness
 each of which an ariyan practises
 and, practising which,
 is an ariyan who is a teacher
 fit to instruct a group,'

 it is said in reference to this.

 §

 When it is said,
 'Of trainers
 he is called the incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,'

 in reference to what is it said?

 When, monks, an elephant to be tamed
 is driven[29] by the elephant-tamer
 it runs in one direction only  to the east
 or west
 or north
 or south.

 When, monks, a horse to be tamed
 is driven by the horse-tamer
 it runs in one direction only  to the east
 or west
 or north
 or south.

 When, monks, a bull to be tamed
 is driven by the bull-tamer
 it runs in one direction only  to the east
 or west
 or north
 or south.

 When, monks, a man to be tamed
 is driven by the Tathāāgata,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 he courses[30] to eight quarters:[31]
 Being in the fine-material sphere,
 he sees material shapes;
 this is the first quarter.

 Not perceiving material shape internally
 he sees external material shapes;
 this is the second quarter.

 By thinking of the Fair,
 he is intent on it;
 this is the third quarter.

 By passing quite beyond perceptions of material shape,
 by sinking perceptions of sensory reactions,
 by not attending to perceptions of variety,
 and thinking,
 'Ether is unending,'
 entering on the plane of infinite ether
 he abides in it;
 this is the fourth quarter.

 By passing quite beyond the plane [271] of infinite ether,
 thinking,
 'Consciousness is unending,'
 entering on the plane of infinite consciousness,
 he abides in it;
 this is the fifth quarter.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of infinite consciousness,
 thinking,
 'There is not anything,'
 entering on the plane of no-thing,
 he abides in it;
 this is the sixth quarter.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of no-thing,
 entering on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
 he abides in it;
 this is the seventh quarter.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of neither-perception-nor-non- perception,
 entering on the stopping of perception and feeling,
 he abides in it;
 this is the eighth quarter.

 When, monks, a man to be tamed
 is driven by the Tathāāgata,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 he courses to these eight quarters.

 When it is said,

 ' Of trainers
 he is called the incomparable charioteer
 of men to be tamed,'

 it is said in reference to this."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
