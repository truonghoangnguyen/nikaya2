# 142. Discourse on the Analysis of Offerings

## Dakkhiṇa-Vibhaṅga Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans in Nigrodha's monastery near Kapilavatthu.

 Then Mahā Pajāpatī[1] the Gotamid,[2]
 bringing a pair of new cloths,[3]
 approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 she sat down at a respectful distance.

 As she was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, this pair of new cloths
 has been cut out by me
 and woven by me
 specially for the Lord;
 revered sir, may the Lord
 out of compassion
 accept it from me."

 When this had been said,
 the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:

 "Give it to the Order,[4] Gotami.

 If you give it to the Order
 I will be honoured
 and the Order too."

 And a second time Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, this pair of new cloths
 has been cut out by me
 and woven by me
 specially for the Lord;
 revered sir, may the Lord
 out of compassion
 accept it from me."

 And a second time,
 the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:

 "Give it to the Order, Gotami.

 If you give it to the Order
 I will be honoured
 and the Order too."

 And a third time[5] Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, this pair of new cloths
 has been cut out by me
 and woven by me
 specially for the Lord;
 revered sir, may the Lord
 out of compassion
 accept it from me."

 And a third time,
 the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:

 "Give it to the Order, Gotami.

 If you give it to the Order
 I will be honoured
 and the Order too."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:

 [301] "Revered sir, let the Lord accept the Gotamid Mahā Pajāpatī's
 new pair of cloths.[6]

 Revered sir, Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid
 has been of much service to the Lord.[7]

 She is his maternal aunt,
 the one who brought him up,[8]
 who looked after him[9]
 and gave him milk,
 for when the Lord's own mother passed away
 she suckled him.[10]

 And, revered sir,
 the Lord has been of much service to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid.

 Revered sir, it is due to the Lord
 that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid
 has gone to the Awakened One for refuge,
 has gone to dhamma for refuge,
 has gone to the Order for refuge.

 Revered sir, it is due to the Lord,
 that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 refrains from taking what has not been given,
 refrains from going wrongly among the sense-pleasures,
 refrains from lying speech,
 refrains from occasions of sloth induced by intoxicants.

 Revered sir, it is due to the Lord that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid
 is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Awakened One,
 is possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma,
 is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Order,
 is possessed of the moral habits pleasing to the ariyans.

 Revered sir, it is due to the Lord that Mahā Pajāpatī
 is not doubtful about anguish,
 is not doubtful about the origin of anguish,
 is not doubtful about the stopping of anguish,
 is not doubtful about the course leading to the stopping of anguish.

 So, revered sir,
 the Lord has been of much service to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid."

 "That is so, Ānanda,
 that is so, Ānanda.

 And if it is due to a person[11]
 that some (other) person[12]
 goes to the Awakened One for refuge,
 to dhamma for refuge,
 to the Order for refuge,
 I say of this person, Ānanda,
 that there is no proper requital
 in regard to that person,
 that is to say as regards greeting,
 rising up for,
 saluting with joined palms,
 doing what is suitable
 (to do for him),
 and as regards procuring him gifts
 of the requisites
 of robes,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.

 If it is due to a person
 that some (other) person
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what [302] has not been given,
 from going wrongly among sense-pleasures,
 from lying speech,
 from occasions of sloth induced by intoxicants,
 I say of this person, Ānanda,
 that there is no proper requital
 in regard to that person,
 that is to say as regards greeting,
 rising up for,
 saluting with joined palms,
 doing what is suitable
 (to do for him),
 and as regards procuring him gifts
 of the requisites
 of robes,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.
 If it is due to a person
 that some (other) person
 is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Awakened One,
 is possessed of unwavering confidence in the dhamma
 is possessed of unwavering confidence in the the Order
 and of the moral habits pleasing to the ariyans,
 I say of this person, Ānanda,
 that there is no proper requital
 in regard to that person,
 that is to say as regards greeting,
 rising up for,
 saluting with joined palms,
 doing what is suitable
 (to do for him),
 and as regards procuring him gifts
 of the requisites
 of robes,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.

 If it is due to a person
 that some (other) person

 is not doubtful about anguish,
 is not doubtful about the origin of anguish,
 is not doubtful about the stopping of anguish,
 is not doubtful about the course leading to the stopping of anguish is not doubtful about anguish,
 I say of this person, Ānanda,
 that there is no proper requital
 in regard to that person,
 that is to say as regards greeting,
 rising up for,
 saluting with joined palms,
 doing what is suitable
 (to do for him),
 and as regards procuring him gifts
 of the requisites
 of robes,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.

 Now, Ānanda, there are these fourteen offerings
 graded as to individuals.[13]

 One gives a gift
 to a Tathāāgata,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One  this is the first offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to one enlightened for and by himself alone[14]  this is the second offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to a Tathāāgata's disciple
 who is one perfected  this is the third offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to one faring along for the realisation
 of the fruit of perfection  this is the fourth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to a non-returner  this is the fifth offering offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of non-returning this is the sixth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to a once-returner  this is the seventh offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of once-returning  this is the eighth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to a stream-attainer  this is the ninth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of stream-attainment  this is the tenth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to one who is beyond and without attachment to sense-pleasures[15]  this is the eleventh offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to an ordinary person of moral habit  this is the twelfth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to an ordinary person of poor moral habit  this is the thirteenth offering graded as to individuals.

 One gives a gift
 to an animal  this is the fourteenth offering graded as to individuals.

 [303] As to this, Ānanda,
 when a gift has been given
 to an animal,
 it is expected that the offering (yields) a hundredfold.[16]

 when a gift has been given
 to an ordinary person of poor moral habit,
 it is to be expected that the offering (yields) a thousandfold.

 When a gift has been given
 to an ordinary person of moral habit,
 it is to be expected that the offering (yields) a hundred thousandfold.

 When a gift[17] has been given
 to one who is beyond and without attachment to sense-pleasures,
 it is to be expected that the offering (yields) a hundred thousandfold of crores.

 When a gift has been given
 to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of stream-attainment,[18]
 it is to be expected that the offering
 (yields) what is incalculable and immeasurable.

 So what can be said of the stream-attainer?

 What can be said of the one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of once-returning?

 What can be said of the once-returner?

 What can be said of one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of non- returning?

 What can be said of the non-retumer?

 What can be said of one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of perfection?

 What can be said of one perfected?
 What can be said of a Tathāāgata's disciple
 who is one perfected?

 What can be said of one enlightened for and by himself alone?

 What can be said of a Tathāāgata, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One?

 And there are these seven kinds of offerings to the Order, Ānanda:

 One gives a gift
 to both Orders
 with the Awakened One at the head[19]  this is the first offering to the Order.[20]

 One gives a gift
 to both Orders
 after the Awakened One has attained final nibbāna[21]  this is the second offering to the Order.

 One gives a gift
 to the Order of monks  this is the third offering to the Order.

 One gives a gift
 to the Order of nuns  this is the fourth offering to the Order.

 One gives a gift,
 saying,
 'May so many monks and nuns be specified for me by the Order'  this is the fifth offering to the Order.
 One [304] gives a gift, saying:
 'May so many monks be specified for me by the Order'  this is the sixth offering to the Order.

 One gives a gift, saying,
 'May so many nuns be specified for me by the Order'  this is the seventh offering to the Order.

 But, Ānanda, in the distant future
 there will be those of the ariyan clan,[22]
 the yellow robes around their necks,[23]
 who will be of bad morality
 and evil character;
 and a gift will be given to the Order
 specially for these of bad morality.

 But when I, Ãnanda, say
 that an offering to the Order
 is incalculable
 and immeasurable
 I by no means say
 that a gift graded as to individuals
 is of greater fruit
 than an offering to the Order.

 There are these four purifications of offerings,[24] Ānanda.
 What four?

 There is, Ānanda,
 the offering purified by the giver
 but not by the recipient.

 There is, Ānanda,
 the offering purified by the recipient
 but not by the giver.

 There is, Ānanda,
 the offering purified
 neither by the giver
 nor the recipient.

 There is, Ānanda,
 the offering purified
 both by the giver
 and the recipient.

 And what offering, Ānanda,
 is purified by the giver
 but not by the recipient?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 the giver is of moral habit
 and lovely character,
 the recipients are of poor morality
 and of evil character.

 It is thus, Ānanda,
 that an offering is purified by the giver
 but not by the recipient.

 ■

 And what offering, Ānanda,
 is purified by the recipient
 but not by the giver?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 the giver is of poor morality
 and evil character,
 the recipients are of moral habit
 and lovely character.

 It is thus, Ānanda,
 that an offering is purified by the recipient
 but not by the giver.

 ■

 And what offering, Ānanda,
 is purified neither by the giver
 nor the recipient?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 the giver is of poor morality
 and evil character
 and the recipients are of poor morality
 and evil character.

 It is thus, Ānanda,
 that an offering is purified neither by the giver
 nor the recipient.

 ■
 And what offering, Ānanda,
 is purified both by the giver
 and the recipient?

 As to this, Ānanda,
 the giver is of moral habit
 and lovely character
 and the recipients are of moral habit
 and lovely character.

 It is thus, Ānanda,
 that an offering is purified both by the giver
 and the recipient.

 These, Ānanda, are the four purifications in offerings."

 Thus spoke the Lord;
 the Well-farer having spoken thus,
 the Teacher further said:

 [305] Whoever, moral in habit, gives to the poor in moral habit
 A gift rightfully acquired, the mind well pleased,[25]
 Firmly believing in the rich fruit of kamma  This is an offering purified by the giver.

 Whoever, poor in moral habit, gives to those of moral habit
 A gift unrightfully acquired, the mind not pleased,
 Not believing in the rich fruit of kamma  This is an offering purified by the recipient.

 Whoever, poor in moral habit, gives to the poor in moral habit
 A gift unrightfully acquired, the mind not pleased,
 Not believing in the rich fruit of kamma  This is an offering purified by neither.

 Whoever, moral in habit, gives to those of moral habit
 A gift rightfully acquired, the mind well pleased,
 Firmly believing in the rich fruit of kamma  I assert this gift to be of abundant fruit.

 Whoever, without attachment,[26] gives to those without attachment
 A gift rightfully acquired, the mind well pleased,
 Firmly believing in the rich fruit of kamma  I assert this gift to be a gift abundant in gain.
