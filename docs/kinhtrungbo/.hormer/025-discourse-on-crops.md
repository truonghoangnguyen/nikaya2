# 25. Discourse on Crops

## Nivāpa Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, a sower does not sow a crop
 for herds of deer,
 thinking:
 'Let the herds of deer,
 enjoying this crop sown by me,
 flourish in good condition
 for many a long day.'

 Monks, the sower sows the crop
 for herds of deer
 thinking:

 'The herds of deer will eat fodder
 encroaching entranced
 on this crop sown by me;
 encroaching entranced
 and eating the fodder,
 they will get elated;

 [195] being elated
 they will get careless;
 being careless
 they will become those
 to be done to
 as one wills
 amid this crop.'

 [The First Herd of Deer]

 Then, monks,
 the first herd of deer ate fodder
 encroaching entranced
 on this crop sown by the sower;
 encroaching entranced and eating the fodder
 these got elated;
 being elated they got careless;
 being careless
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus, monks, this first herd of deer
 did not escape
 from the sower's mastery.[1]

 [The Second Herd of Deer]

 Then, monks, the second herd of deer realised:

 'The first herd of deer
 has eaten fodder
 encroaching entranced on that crop
 sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there
 got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus this first herd of deer
 did not escape
 from the sower's mastery.

 ■

 Suppose that we should all refrain
 from eating the crops;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there is fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 should stay there?'
 So all these refrained
 from eating the crops;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there was fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 they stayed there.

 In the last month of the hot weather
 the grass and water gave out,
 and their bodies became extremely emaciated
 so that their strength and energy diminished,
 and with diminished strength and energy
 they came back again to those crops
 sown by the sower;
 encroaching entranced
 they ate the fodder there;
 encroaching entranced
 and eating the fodder there,
 they got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus, monks, neither did the second herd of deer
 escape from the sower's mastery.

 [The Third Herd of Deer]

 Then, monks, the third herd of deer realised:

 'The first herd of deer
 has eaten fodder
 encroaching entranced on that crop
 sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there
 got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus this first herd of deer
 did not escape
 from the sower's mastery.

 ■

 Then that second herd of deer realised thus:

 "The first herd of deer
 has eaten fodder
 encroaching entranced on that crop
 sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there
 got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus this first herd of deer
 did not escape
 from the sower's mastery.

 Suppose that we should all refrain
 from eating the crops;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there is fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 should stay there?"

 So all these refrained
 from eating the crops;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there was fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 stayed there.

 In the last month of the hot weather
 the grass and water gave out,
 and their bodies became extremely emaciated
 so that their strength and energy diminished,
 and with diminished strength and energy
 they came back again to those crops
 sown by the sower;
 encroaching entranced
 they ate the fodder there;
 encroaching entranced
 and eating the fodder there,
 they got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.'
 Suppose that we should make a lair[2]
 near those crops sown by the sower,
 so that we can eat fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on those crops sown by the sower;
 and then, having made the lair
 and not encroaching entranced
 on the crops sown by the sower,
 we will not get elated;
 not being elated
 we will not get careless;
 not being careless,
 we will not become those
 to be done to
 as the sower wills
 amid that crop.'

 These made a lair
 near that crop sown by the sower;
 having made the lair,
 they ate fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on the crops sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder
 not encroaching entranced there,
 did not get elated;
 not being elated,
 they did not get careless;
 not being careless,
 they did not become those
 to be done to as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 ■
 Thereupon, monks,
 it occurred to the sower and his companions:

 'This third herd of deer
 must be crafty and wily;
 this third herd of deer
 must have potency[3]
 and be demons;[4]
 they eat this crop that was sown,
 but we do not know of their comings or goings.

 Suppose that we were to enclose
 this crop that was sown
 with large stakes and snares on all sides?

 Then we might see the lair
 of the third herd of deer,
 where they might go to take it.'[5]

 So these enclosed
 that crop that was sown
 with large stakes and snares on all sides.

 Then, monks, the sower and his companions
 saw the lair of the third herd of deer,
 where they went to take it.

 Thus, monks, neither did this third herd of deer
 escape from the sower's mastery.

 [The Fourth Herd of Deer]

 Thereupon, monks, the fourth herd of deer realised thus:

 'The first herd of deer
 has eaten fodder
 encroaching entranced on that crop
 sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there
 got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus this first herd of deer
 did not escape
 from the sower's mastery.

 ■

 Then that second herd of deer realised thus:

 "The first herd of deer
 has eaten fodder
 encroaching entranced on that crop
 sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there
 got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thus this first herd of deer
 did not escape
 from the sower's mastery.
 Suppose that we should all refrain
 from eating the crops;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there is fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 should stay there?"

 So all these refrained
 from eating the crops;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there was fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 they stayed there.

 In the last month of the hot weather
 the grass and water gave out,
 and their bodies became extremely emaciated
 so that their strength and energy diminished,
 and with diminished strength and energy
 they came back again to those crops
 sown by the sower;
 encroaching entranced
 they ate the fodder there;
 encroaching entranced
 and eating the fodder there,
 they got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to
 as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Suppose that we should make a lair
 near those crops sown by the sower,
 so that we can eat fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on those crops sown by the sower;
 and then, having made the lair
 and not encroaching entranced
 on the crops sown by the sower,
 we will not get elated;
 not being elated
 we will not get careless;
 not being careless,
 we will not become those
 to be done to
 as the sower wills
 amid that crop."

 These made a lair
 near that crop sown by the sower;
 having made the lair,
 they ate fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on the crops sown by the sower;
 these, eating fodder
 not encroaching entranced there,
 did not get elated;
 not being elated,
 they did not get careless;
 not being careless,
 they did not become those
 to be done to as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thereupon, it occurred to the sower and his companions:

 "This third herd of deer
 must be crafty and wily;
 this third herd of deer
 must have potency
 and be demons;
 they eat this crop that was sown,
 but we do not know of their comings or goings.

 Suppose that we were to enclose
 this crop that was sown
 with large stakes and snares on all sides?

 Then we might see the lair
 of the third herd of deer,
 where they might go to take it."

 So these enclosed
 that crop that was sown
 with large stakes and snares on all sides.

 Then the sower and his companions
 saw the lair of the third herd of deer,
 where they went to take it.

 Thus neither did this third herd of deer
 escape from the sower's mastery.'

 ■

 Suppose that we were to make a lair
 somewhere where the sower and his companions
 do not come?

 Having made our lair there,
 we might eat fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on that crop sown by the sower;
 eating fodder
 not encroaching entranced,
 we will not get elated;
 not being elated,
 we will not get careless;
 not being careless,

 [198] we will not become those
 to be done to as the sower wills
 amid that crop.'

 These made a lair
 somewhere where the sower and his companions
 did not come;
 having made a lair there,
 they ate fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on that crop sown by the sower;
 these eating fodder
 not encroaching entranced there,
 did not get elated;
 not being elated,
 they did not get careless;
 not being careless,
 they did not become those
 to be done to as the sower willed
 amid that crop.

 Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:

 'This fourth herd of deer
 must be crafty and wily;
 this fourth herd of deer
 must have potency and be demons;
 they eat this crop that was sown,
 but we do not know of their comings or goings.

 Suppose that we were to enclose
 this crop that was sown
 with large stakes and snares on all sides?
 Then we might see the lair
 of the fourth herd of deer,
 where they might go to take it.'

 So these enclosed that crop that was sown
 with large stakes and snares on all sides.

 But, monks, neither the sower nor his companions
 saw the lair of this fourth herd of deer,
 where they might go to take it.

 Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:

 'If we beat up this fourth herd of deer,
 these, beaten up,
 will beat up others;
 these, beaten up,
 will beat up others,
 and so all the deer
 will neglect this crop that was sown.

 Suppose that we were not to interfere
 with the fourth herd of deer?'

 So, monks, neither the sower nor his companions
 interfered with the fourth herd of deer.

 Thus, monks, this fourth herd of deer
 escaped the sower's mastery.

 Monks, this parable was made by me
 to illustrate the meaning.
 And just this is the meaning here:

 'The crop,' monks,
 this is a synonym for the five strands of sense-pleasures.

 'The sower,' monks,
 this is a name for Māra, the Evil One.

 'The sower's companions,' monks,
 this is a synonym for Māra's companions.

 'The herds of deer,' monks,

 this is a synonym for recluses and brahmans.

 [The First Kind of Recluse and Brahman]

 Where, monks, the first kind of recluse and brahman
 ate fodder encroaching entranced
 on that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world  these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;
 being elated,
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.

 Thus, monks, the first kind of recluses and brahmans
 did not escape from Māra's mastery.

 [199] I, monks, say
 that this first kind of recluse and brahman
 is like that first herd of deer in the parable.

 [The Second Kind of Recluse and Brahman]

 Then, monks, the second kind of recluse and brahman realised:

 'That first kind of recluses and brahmans
 ate fodder encroaching entranced
 on a crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;
 being elated,
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.'

 Suppose that we should all refrain
 from eating the crop  material things of the world;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there is fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 should stay there?'

 All these refrained from eating the crop  material things of the world;
 refraining from enjoyment
 where there was fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 they stayed there.
 There these became those feeding[6] on potherbs
 they became those feeding on millet
 they became those feeding on rice
 they became those feeding on snippets of leather
 they became those feeding on water-plants
 they became those feeding on the red powder of rice husks
 they became those feeding on the discarded scum of rice on the boil
 they became those feeding on the flour of oil-seeds
 they became those feeding on grass
 they became those feeding on cowdung.

 they became those who subsisted
 on forest roots and fruits,
 eating the fruits that had fallen.

 In the last month of the hot weather,
 when the grass and water dried up,
 their bodies became extremely emaciated;
 because their bodies were extremely emaciated
 their strength and energy diminished;
 because their strength and energy diminished,
 freedom of mind diminished;
 because freedom of mind diminished,
 they went back again
 to that very crop sown by Māra  material things of the world.

 They ate fodder
 encroaching entranced there;
 eating fodder encroaching entranced there,
 they got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  those material things of the world.

 Thus, monks, neither did this second kind of recluse and brahman
 escape from Māra's mastery.

 I, monks, say that this second kind of recluse and brahman
 is like that second herd of deer in that parable.

 [The Third Kind of Recluse and Brahman]

 Then, monks, the third kind of recluse and brahman realised:

 'That first kind of recluses and brahmans
 ate fodder encroaching entranced
 on a crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;
 being elated,
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.

 Then the second kind of recluse and brahman realised:

 "That first kind of recluses and brahmans
 ate fodder en- [200] croaching entranced
 on a crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;
 being elated,
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.'

 Suppose that we should all refrain
 from eating the crop  material things of the world;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there is fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 should stay there?"

 All these refrained from eating the crop  material things of the world;
 refraining from enjoyment
 where there was fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 they stayed there.

 There these became those feeding on potherbs
 they became those feeding on millet
 they became those feeding on rice
 they became those feeding on snippets of leather
 they became those feeding on water-plants
 they became those feeding on the red powder of rice husks
 they became those feeding on the discarded scum of rice on the boil
 they became those feeding on the flour of oil-seeds
 they became those feeding on grass
 they became those feeding on cowdung.

 they became those who subsisted
 on forest roots and fruits,
 eating the fruits that had fallen.

 In the last month of the hot weather,
 when the grass and water dried up,
 their bodies became extremely emaciated;
 because their bodies were extremely emaciated
 their strength and energy diminished;
 because their strength and energy diminished,
 freedom of mind diminished;
 because freedom of mind diminished,
 they went back again
 to that very crop sown by Māra  material things of the world.

 They ate fodder
 encroaching entranced there;
 eating fodder encroaching entranced there,
 they got elated;
 being elated
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  those material things of the world.

 Thus neither did this second kind of recluse and brahman
 escape from Māra's mastery.

 ■

 Suppose that we should make a lair
 near that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 having made a lair there,
 we will eat fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 eating fodder not encroaching entranced,
 we will not get elated;
 not being elated,
 we will not get careless;
 not being careless,
 we will not become those
 to be done to by Māra as he wills
 amid that crop-material things of the world.'

 These made a lair near that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 having made a lair there,
 they ate fodder
 not encroaching entranced on that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating fodder not encroaching entranced there,
 did not get elated;
 not being elated,
 they did not get careless;
 not being careless,
 they did not become those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.

 Nevertheless they came to be of views like this:
 that the world is eternal,
 also that the world is not eternal;
 and that the world is an ending thing,
 also that the world is not an ending thing;
 and that the life principle and the body are the same,
 also that the life principle and the body are different;
 and that the Tathāgata becomes after dying,
 also that the Tathāgata does not become after dying,
 also that the Tathāgata both becomes and does not become after dying,
 also that the Tathāgata neither becomes nor does not become after dying.

 Thus, monks, neither did this third kind of recluse and brahman
 escape from Māra's mastery.

 I, monks, say that this third kind of recluse and brahman
 is like that third herd of deer in the parable.

 [The Fourth Kind of Recluse and Brahman]

 Then, monks, the fourth kind of recluse and brahman realised thus:

 'That first kind of recluses and brahmans
 ate fodder encroaching entranced
 on a crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;
 being elated,
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.

 ■

 Then the second kind of recluse and brahman realised:

 "That first kind of recluses and brahmans
 ate fodder encroaching entranced
 on a crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;
 being elated,
 they got careless;
 being careless,
 they became those
 to be done to by Māra as he willed
 amid that crop  material things of the world.'

 Suppose that we should all refrain
 from eating the crop  material things of the world;
 and refraining from enjoyment
 where there is fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 should stay there?"

 All these refrained from eating the crop  material things of the world;
 refraining from enjoyment
 where there was fear,
 having plunged into a stretch of forest,
 they stayed there.

 There these became those feeding on potherbs
 they became those feeding on millet
 they became those feeding on rice
 they became those feeding on snippets of leather

 Thus neither did this second kind of recluse and brahman
 escape from Māra's mastery.

 ■

 Then the third kind of recluse and brahman realised:

 'That first kind of recluses and brahmans
 ate fodder encroaching entranced
 on a crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 these, eating the fodder
 and encroaching entranced there,
 got elated;

 Then the second kind of recluse and brahman realised:

 "That first kind of recluses and brahmans

 Suppose that we should all refrain

 All these refrained from eating the crop  material things of the world;

 ■

 Suppose that we should make a lair
 near that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 having made a lair there,

 These made a lair near that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 having made a lair there,

 also that the Tathāgata neither becomes nor does not become after dying.

 Thus neither did this third kind of recluse and brahman
 escape from Māra's mastery.'

 Suppose that we should make a lair
 where Māra
 and Māra's companions
 do not come;
 having made that lair,
 we can eat fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world;
 eating fodder not encroaching entranced,
 we will not get elated;
 not being elated
 we will not get careless,
 not being careless
 we will not become those
 to be done to by Māra as he wills

 These made a lair where Māra
 and Māra's companions
 did not come;
 having made a lair there,
 they ate fodder
 not encroaching entranced
 on that crop sown by Māra  material things of the world.

 These, eating fodder
 not encroaching entranced there,
 did not get elated;
 not being elated,
 they did not get careless;
 not being careless,
 they did not become those

 Thus, monks, the fourth kind of recluses and brahmans
 escaped from Māra's mastery.
 I, monks, say that the fourth kind of recluse and brahman
 is like that fourth herd of deer in the parable.

 And how, monks, is there non-entry[7] of Māra
 and Māra's companions?

 Herein, monks, a monk,
 aloof from the pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 [202] Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one[8] who has put a darkness round Māra,[9]
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.
 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.
 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk
 by passing quite beyond perception of material shapes,
 by the going down of perception of sensory reactions,
 by not attending to perception of variety,
 thinking:
 'Ether is unending,'
 enters on
 and abides in the plane of infinite ether.

 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk
 by passing quite beyond the plane of infinite ether,
 thinking:
 'Consciousness is unending,'
 enters on
 and abides in
 the plane of infinite consciousness.

 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by passing quite beyond the plane of infinite consciousness,
 thinking:
 'There is not anything,'
 enters on
 and abides in
 the plane of no-thing.

 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by passing quite beyond the plane of no-thing,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One.

 [203] And again, monks, a monk,
 by passing quite beyond the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the stopping of perception and feeling;
 and having seen by intuitive wisdom,
 his cankers are utterly destroyed.

 Monks, this kind of monk is called
 one who has put a darkness round Māra,
 and who,
 having blotted out Māra's vision
 so that it has no range,
 goes unseen by the Evil One
 he has crossed over the entanglement in the world."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
