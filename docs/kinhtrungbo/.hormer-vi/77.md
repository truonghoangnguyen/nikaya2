# 77. Greater Discourse to Sakuludāyin

## Mahā Sakuludāyi Sutta

#### [203]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove
 at the squirrels' feeding place.[1]

 Now at that time a number of very celebrated wanderers, such as Anugāra,[2]
 Varadhara
 and the wanderer Sakuludāyin,
 and other celebrated wanderers,
 were staying in the wanderers' park
 at the peacocks' feeding place.

 Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Rājagaha for almsfood.
 Then it occurred to the Lord:

 "It is too early to walk for almsfood in Rājagaha.

 Suppose I were to approach the wanderers' park,
 the peacocks' feeding place
 and the wanderer Sakuludāyin?"

 Then the Lord approached the peacocks' feeding place
 in the wanderers' park.

 Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyin
 was sitting down with the great company of wanderers
 shouting out with a loud noise,
 a great noise,
 talking various kinds of inferior talk
 that is to say:
 talk on kings,
 thieves,
 great ministers,
 armies,
 fears,
 battles,
 food,
 drink,
 clothes,
 beds,
 garlands,
 scents,
 relations,
 vehicles,
 villages,
 market towns,
 towns,
 the country,
 women,
 heroes,
 streets,
 wells,
 those departed before,
 talk of diversity,
 speculation about the world,
 speculation about the sea,
 talk about becoming or not becoming
 thus or thus.[3]

 The wanderer Sakuludāyin saw the Lord coming in the distance;
 seeing him,
 he called his own company to order, saying: "Good sirs, let there be little noise;
 do not, good sirs, make a noise;
 this is the recluse Gotama who is coming.

 The recluse Gotama wishes for little noise,
 is trained to little noise,
 praises little noise.

 So he may consider approaching
 if he knows that this is a company of little noise."

 Then these wanderers fell silent.

 Then the Lord approached the wanderer Sakuludāyin.

 The wanderer Sakuludāyin spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Let the revered Gotama come,
 there is a welcome for the revered Gotama;
 it is long since the revered Gotama made this opportunity!||
 that is to say for coming here.

 Let the revered Gotama sit down,
 this seat is ready."
 Then the Lord sat down on the seat that was ready.

 And the wanderer Sakuludāyin,
 having taken a low seat,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus to the wanderer Sakuludāyin
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "What is the talk
 for which you are now gathered together here, Udāyin?

 [204] And what was your talk that was interrupted?"

 "Let be that talk, revered sir, for which we are now gathered together here.

 It will not be difficult for the Lord to hear this talk later.

 Some time ago,[4] revered sir,
 when divers members of other sects,
 recluses and brahmans,
 were gathered together
 and were sitting down in the debating hall,[5]
 this chance conversation arose:

 'Indeed it is profitable for the people of Aṅga-Magadha,
 indeed it is well gotten by the people of Aṅga-Magadha
 that these leaders in religious life,
 heads of companies,
 heads of groups,
 teachers of groups,
 well known,
 famous founders of sects,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk,[6]
 have come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.
 This Pūraṇa Kassapa is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 This Makkhali Gosāla too is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 This Ajita of the hair-blanket too is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 This Pakudha Kaccāyana too is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 This Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son too is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 This Nātaputta the Jain too is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 This recluse Gotama too is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk;
 he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.

 Now of these lords,
 heads of companies,
 heads of groups,
 teachers of groups,
 well known,
 famous founders of sects,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk,
 which is revered,
 respected,
 esteemed,
 honoured by disciples?

 And how do disciples,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence?
 Some of those who were there spoke thus:

 'This Pūraṇa Kassapa
 is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 teacher of a group,
 well known,
 a famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk.

 But he is not revered,
 respected,
 esteemed,
 honoured by disciples,
 nor do disciples,
 revering and respecting him,
 live in dependence on Pūraṇa Kassapa.

 Once upon a time Pūraṇa Kassapa was teaching dhamma
 to an innumerable assembly.

 But a certain disciple of his let it be heard:

 "Do not, good sirs, ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about this matter;
 he does not know about it,
 we know about it.

 Ask us about this matter,
 we can explain it to the good sirs."

 Once upon a time Pūraṇa Kassapa,
 with outstretched arms [205] and wailing,
 did not get the chance (to say[7]):

 "Let the good sirs be quiet;
 do not,
 good sirs,
 make a noise.

 These are not asking the good sirs,
 they are asking us,
 we will explain to them.

 "Then many of Pūraṇa Kassapa's disciples,
 having refuted him,
 on seceding,[8] said:

 "You do not understand[9] this dhamma and discipline,
 I understand this dhamma and discipline.

 How can you understand this dhamma and discipline?

 You are faring along wrongly,
 I am faring along rightly.

 There is sense in what I say,
 no sense in what you say.

 You said at the end
 what should have been said at the beginning,
 and said at the beginning
 what should have been said at the end.

 Your method is reversed,[10]
 you are refuted,[11]
 you are caught out,[12]
 go away and think out your words,[13]
 or unravel them if you can."

 So Pūraṇa Kassapa is not revered,
 respected,
 esteemed,
 honoured by disciples,
 nor do disciples,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence on Pūraṇa Kassapa.

 On the contrary, Pūraṇa Kassapa is reviled with abuse
 for his behaviour.'[14]

 Some spoke thus:

 'This Makkhali Gosāla too
 is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 teacher of a group,
 well known,
 a famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk.

 But he is not revered,

 honoured by disciples,
 nor do disciples,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence on Makkhali Gosāla.

 On the contrary, Makkhali Gosāla is reviled with abuse
 for his behaviour.'

 Some spoke thus:

 Some spoke thus:

 'This recluse Gotama is the head of a company,
 head of a group,
 the teacher of a group,
 he is well known,
 the famous founder of a sect,
 held in high repute by the manyfolk.

 He is revered,
 respected,
 esteemed,
 honoured by disciples;
 and disciples,
 revering and respecting the recluse Gotama,
 live in dependence on him.

 Once upon a time
 the recluse Gotama was teaching dhamma
 to an innumerable assembly.

 Then a certain disciple of the recluse Gotama coughed.

 A fellow Brahma-farer touched him with his knee
 and said:

 "Let the venerable one be quiet;
 let the venerable one make no noise.

 The Teacher, our Lord,
 is teaching dhamma."

 [206] At the time when the recluse Gotama was teaching dhamma
 to an innumerable assembly,
 there was the sound
 neither of expectoration
 nor of coughing
 among his disciples.[15]

 Any group of people
 who were waiting
 were ready for him,
 thinking:

 "We will hear that dhamma
 that the Lord will teach us."

 It is as though a man
 at a crossing on a high road
 might press out a little pure honey,[16]
 and any group of people who were waiting
 might be ready for him.

 Even so at the time
 when the recluse Gotama was teaching dhamma
 to an innumerable assembly,
 there was the sound
 neither of expectoration
 nor of coughing
 among his disciples.

 Any group of people
 who were waiting
 were ready for him,
 thinking:

 "We will hear that dhamma
 that the Lord will teach us."

 And those disciples of the recluse Gotama who,
 quarrelling with fellow Brahma-farers
 and disavowing the training,
 return to the secular life,
 even these are speakers in praise of the Teacher,
 they are speakers in praise of dhamma
 and speakers in praise of the Order.

 They censure only themselves,
 they do not censure others,
 but say:

 "It is we ourselves that are unfortunate,
 it is we that are of little merit,
 in that we,
 although we have gone forth thus
 in this dhamma and discipline
 that are well taught,
 are unable
 for as long as life lasts
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 wholly complete,
 wholly purified."

 These, becoming monastery attendants
 or lay-disciples,
 live undertaking the five rules of training.

 Thus it is that the recluse Gotama is revered,
 respected,
 esteemed,
 honoured by disciples,
 and that disciples,
 revering and respecting the recluse Gotama,
 live in dependence on him.'"

 "But how many things do you behold in me, Udāyin,
 for which my disciples revere,
 respect,
 esteem and honour me,
 and revering and respecting,
 live in dependence (on me)?"

 "I, revered sir, behold five things
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 and honour the Lord,
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 What are the five?

 Revered sir, the Lord eats little
 and speaks in praise of eating little.

 That the Lord eats little
 and speaks in praise of eating little,
 this is the first thing
 that I, revered sir,
 behold in the Lord
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 and honour the Lord,
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, revered sir,
 the Lord is contented
 with any kind of robe-material
 and speaks in praise of content
 with any kind of robe-material.
 This is the second thing
 that I, revered sir,
 behold in the Lord
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 and honour the Lord,
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 [207] And again, revered sir,
 the Lord is contented
 with any kind of almsfood
 and speaks in praise of content
 with any kind of almsfood.

 This is the third thing
 that I, revered sir,
 behold in the Lord
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 and honour the Lord,
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, revered sir,
 the Lord is contented
 with any kind of lodgings
 and speaks in praise of content
 with any kind of lodgings.

 This is the fourth thing
 that I, revered sir,
 behold in the Lord
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 and honour the Lord,
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, revered sir,
 the Lord is aloof[17] and speaks in praise of aloofness.

 That the Lord is aloof and speaks in praise of aloofness, this is the fifth
 that I, revered sir,
 behold in the Lord
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 and honour the Lord,
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 These, revered sir,
 are the five things
 I behold in the Lord
 for which disciples revere,

 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence."

 and who for eight months
 do not go under a roof.

 But I, Udāyin,
 sometimes stay in gabled houses,
 smeared inside and out,
 sheltered from the winds,
 having door-bolts that fasten

 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 But there are, Udāyin,
 five other things
 for which disciples revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me and,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 What are the five?
 As to this, Udāyin,
 disciples of mine
 admire the higher morality,
 and think:

 'The recluse Gotama is of moral habit,
 he is possessed of the most excellent body of moral habit.'

 Inas- [210] much, Udāyin,
 as disciples of mine
 admire the higher morality,
 and think:
 'The recluse Gotama is of moral habit,
 he is possessed of the most excellent body of moral habit.'

 This is the first thing, Udāyin,
 for which disciples of mine revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me and,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, Udāyin, disciples of mine
 admire the surpassing know-ledge-and-vision,
 and think:

 'When the recluse Gotama says:

 "I know, I see" it is because he does know,
 does see.

 The recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 from super-knowledge,
 not without super-knowledge;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 that has a causal basis[24],
 not without a causal basis;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 that is convincing,[25] not unconvincing.'

 Inasmuch, Udāyin,
 as disciples of mine admire
 the surpassing knowledge-and-vision,
 and think:
 'When the recluse Gotama says:
 "I know, I see"  it is because he does know,
 does see.

 The recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 from super-knowledge,
 not without super-knowledge;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 that has a causal basis,
 not without a causal basis;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 that is convincing,
 not unconvincing.'

 This is the second thing, Udāyin,
 for which disciples of mine revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me and,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, Udāyin,
 disciples of mine admire the higher wisdom,
 and the situation does not occur when they think:

 'The recluse Gotama is wise;
 he is endowed with the most excellent body of wisdom.

 (Yet) he will not see (in advance)
 a future way of speech[26]
 nor will he refute with dhamma[27]
 a present opposed teaching
 that is rightly (to be) refuted.'

 What do you think about this, Udāyin?

 Could disciples of mine,
 knowing thus,
 seeing thus,
 interrupt a chance conversation?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "It is not I, Udāyin,
 that expect instruction from disciples;
 on the contrary,
 it is the disciples themselves
 that expect instruction from me.[28]
 So that, Udāyin,
 the situation does not occur
 when disciples [211] of mine
 who admire the higher wisdom think:

 'He would neither see (in advance)
 a future way of speech
 nor would he refute with dhamma
 a present opposed teaching
 that is rightly (to be) refuted.'

 This is the third thing, Udāyin, for which disciples of mine revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me and,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, Udāyin,
 those disciples of mine
 who are beset by some anguish,
 overwhelmed by anguish,
 having approached me,
 ask about the ariyan truth of anguish.

 On being asked by them
 about the ariyan truth of anguish,
 I explain.

 I bend my mind to the answer to their question.
 And again, Udāyin,
 those disciples of mine
 who are beset by some anguish,
 overwhelmed by anguish,
 having approached me,
 ask about about the ariyan truth of the uprising of anguish.

 On being asked by them
 about the ariyan truth of anguish,
 I explain.

 I bend my mind to the answer to their question.

 And again, Udāyin,
 those disciples of mine
 who are beset by some anguish,
 overwhelmed by anguish,
 having approached me,
 ask about about the ariyan truth of the stopping of anguish.

 On being asked by them
 about the ariyan truth of anguish,
 I explain.

 I bend my mind to the answer to their question.

 And again, Udāyin,
 those disciples of mine
 who are beset by some anguish,
 overwhelmed by anguish,
 having approached me,
 ask about about the ariyan truth of the course leading to the stopping of anguish.

 On being asked by them
 about the ariyan truth leading to the stopping of anguish,
 I explain.
 I bend my mind to the answer to their question.

 This is the fourth thing, Udāyin,
 for which disciples of mine revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me and,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the four applications of mindfulness.[29]

 Herein, Udāyin,
 a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body,
 ardent,
 clearly conscious (of it),
 mindful (of it),
 so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world.

 He fares along contemplating the feelings in the feelings,
 ardent,
 clearly conscious (of it),
 mindful (of it),
 so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world.

 He fares along contemplating the mind in the mind,
 ardent,
 clearly conscious (of it),
 mindful (of it),
 so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world.

 He fares along contemplating fares along contemplating mental objects in mental objects,
 ardent,
 clearly conscious (of it),
 mindful (of it),
 so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world.

 As to this,
 many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.[30]

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the four right strivings.[31]

 Herein, Udāyin,
 a monk generates desire,
 he endeavours,
 stirs up energy,
 exerts his mind
 and strives for the non-arising
 of evil unskilled states of mind
 that have not arisen;

 he generates desire,
 he endeavours,
 stirs up energy,
 exerts his mind
 and strives for the getting rid [212] of evil unskilled states of mind
 that have arisen;

 he generates desire,

 exerts his mind
 and strives for the arising of skilled states of mind
 that have not arisen;

 he generates desire,
 he endeavours,
 stirs up energy,
 exerts his mind
 and strives for the maintenance,
 preservation,
 increase,
 maturity,
 development
 and completion
 of skilled states of mind
 that have arisen.

 As to this,
 many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §
 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the four bases of psychic power.[32]

 Herein, Udāyin,
 a monk cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of intention
 with activities of striving;

 he cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of energy
 with activities of striving;

 he cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of consciousness
 with activities of striving;

 he cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of investigation
 with activities of striving.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the five controlling faculties.[33]
 Herein,Udāyin,
 a monk develops the controlling faculty of faith,
 leading to tranquillity,
 leading to awakening;

 he develops the controlling faculty of energy,
 leading to tranquillity,
 leading to awakening;

 he develops the controlling faculty of mindfulness,
 leading to tranquillity,
 leading to awakening;

 he develops the controlling faculty of concentration,

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the five powers.
 Herein, Udāyin,
 a monk develops the power of faith,

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the seven limbs [213] of awakening.[34]
 Herein, Udāyin, a monk develops mindfulness as a limb of awakening
 and which is dependent on aloofness,
 dependent on dispassion,
 dependent on stopping,
 ending in renunciation;

 he develops investigation of dhamma as a limb of awakening
 and which is dependent on aloofness,
 dependent on dispassion,
 dependent on stopping,
 ending in renunciation;

 he develops energy as a limb of awakening
 and which is dependent on aloofness,
 dependent on dispassion,

 he develops even-mindedness as a limb of awakening
 and which is dependent on aloofness,

 dependent on stopping,
 ending in renunciation.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the ariyan eightfold Way.

 Herein, Udāyin, a monk
 develops perfect view,
 he develops perfect intention,
 he develops perfect speech,
 he develops perfect action,
 he develops perfect mode of livelihood,
 he develops perfect endeavour,
 he develops perfect mindfulness,
 he develops perfect concentration.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.
 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the eight Deliverances.[35]

 Being in the fine-material sphere,
 he sees material shapes;
 this is the first deliverance.

 Not perceiving material shape internally
 he sees external material shapes;
 this is the second deliverance.

 By thinking of the Fair,[36] he is intent on it;
 this is the third deliverance.

 By passing quite beyond perceptions of material shapes,
 by the going down of perceptions of sensory reactions,
 by not attending to perceptions of variety,
 thinking:

 'Ether is unending'

 entering on the plane of infinite ether,
 he abides in it;
 this is the fourth deliverance.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of infinite ether,
 thinking:

 'Consciousness is unending,'
 entering on the plane of infinite consciousness,
 he abides in it;
 this is the fifth deliverance.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of infinite consciousness,
 thinking:

 'There is not anything,'

 entering on the plane of no-thing,
 he abides in it;
 this is the sixth deliverance.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of no-thing,
 entering on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
 he abides in it;
 this is the seventh deliverance.

 By passing quite beyond the plane of neither-perception-nor-non- perception,
 entering on the stopping of perception and feeling,
 he abides in it;
 this is the eighth deliverance.

 [214] As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the eight spheres of mastery.[37]

 Perceiving material shape internally,
 one sees external material shapes,
 small,
 comely,
 ugly,
 and he is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see';

 this is the first sphere of mastery.

 Perceiving material shape internally,
 another sees external material shapes,
 illimitable,
 comely,
 ugly,
 and he is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see';

 this is the second sphere of mastery.

 Not perceiving material shape internally,
 another sees external material shapes,
 small,
 comely,
 ugly,
 and he is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see';
 this is the third sphere of mastery.

 Not perceiving material shape internally,
 another sees external material shapes,
 illimitable,
 comely,
 ugly,
 and he is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see';

 this is the fourth sphere of mastery.

 Not perceiving material shape internally,
 another sees external material shapes that are blue-green,[38]
 blue-green in colour,
 blue-green in appearance,
 reflecting blue-green.

 As the flax blossom is blue-green,
 blue-green in colour,
 blue-green in appearance,
 reflecting blue-green;
 or again, as that fine muslin of Benares,
 of delicate finish on both sides,
 is blue-green
 blue-green in colour,
 blue-green in appearance,
 reflecting blue-green,
 even so anyone who,
 not perceiving material shape internally,
 sees external material shapes that are blue-green,
 blue-green in colour,
 blue-green in appearance,
 reflecting blue-green,
 is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see'

 this is the fifth sphere of mastery.

 Not perceiving material shape internally,
 another sees external material shapes that are yellow,
 yellow in colour,
 yellow in appearance,
 reflecting yellow.

 As the kaṇṇikāra blossom is yellow,
 yellow in colour,
 yellow in appearance,
 reflecting yellow,
 or again, as that fine muslin of Benares,
 of delicate finish on both sides,
 is yellow,
 yellow in colour,
 yellow in appearance,
 reflecting yellow,
 even so anyone who,
 not perceiving material shape internally,
 sees external material shapes that are
 yellow,
 yellow in colour,
 yellow in appearance,
 reflecting yellow,
 is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see'

 this is the sixth sphere of mastery.
 Not perceiving material shape internally,[215]
 another sees external material shapes that are red,
 red in colour,
 red in appearance,
 reflecting red.

 As the bandhujīvaka blossom is red,
 red in colour,
 red in appearance,
 reflecting red
 or again, as that fine muslin of Benares,
 of delicate finish on both sides,
 is red,
 red in colour,
 red in appearance,
 reflecting red
 even so anyone who,
 not perceiving material shape internally,
 sees external material shapes that are
 red,
 red in colour,
 red in appearance,
 reflecting red,
 is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see'

 this is the seventh sphere of mastery.

 Not perceiving material shape internally,
 another sees external material shapes that are white,
 white in colour,
 white in appearance,
 reflecting white.
 As the morning star is white,
 white in colour,
 white in appearance,
 reflecting white,
 or again, as that fine muslin of Benares,
 of delicate finish on both sides,
 is white,
 white in colour,
 white in appearance,
 reflecting white,
 even so anyone who,
 not perceiving material shape internally,
 sees external material shapes
 that are white,
 white in colour,
 white in appearance,
 reflecting white,
 is one perceiving thus:

 'Having mastered them,
 I know, I see';

 this is the eighth sphere of mastery.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the ten spheres of the devices.[39]

 One is aware of the earth-device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable;

 another is aware of the water-device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable;

 another is aware of the fire-device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable;

 another is aware of the wind-device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable;

 another is aware of the blue-green device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable;

 another is aware of the yellow device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable;

 another is aware of the red device
 above,

 another is aware of the white device

 another is aware of the space device

 another is aware of the consciousness device
 above,
 below,
 across,
 undivided,
 illimitable.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 develop the four meditations.

 Herein, Udāyin, a monk, aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 enters and abides in the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 He drenches,[40]
 saturates,
 permeates,
 suffuses
 this very body
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of aloofness;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with the rapture and joy
 that are [216] born of aloofness.
 Udāyin, as a skilled bath-attendant or his apprentice,
 having sprinkled bath-powder into a bronze vessel,
 might knead it together with drops of water
 until the ball of lather has taken up moisture,
 is drenched with moisture,
 suffused with moisture
 inside and out,
 but there is no oozing  even so, Udāyin, does a monk
 drench,
 saturate,
 permeate,
 suffuse
 this very body
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of aloofness;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of aloofness.

 And again, Udāyin, a monk, by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 with the mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 He drenches,
 saturates,
 permeates,
 suffuses
 this very body
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of concentration;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of concentration.

 Udāyin, as a pool of water
 with water welling up within it,
 but which has no inlet for water from the eastern side,
 no inlet for water from the western side,
 no inlet for water from the northern side,
 no inlet for water from the southern side,
 and even if the god did not send down showers upon it
 from time to time,
 yet a current of cool water
 having welled up from that pool
 would drench,
 saturate,
 permeate,
 suffuse
 that pool with cool water;
 there would be no part of that pool
 that was not suffused with cool water.

 Even so, Udāyin, does a monk
 drench,
 saturate,
 permeate,
 suffuse
 this very body
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of concentration;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with the rapture and joy
 that are born of concentration.
 And again, Udāyin, a monk
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:

 'Joyful lives he
 who has equanimity
 and is mindful,'

 and he enters on and abides in
 the third meditation.

 He drenches,
 saturates,
 permeates,
 suffuses
 this very body
 with the joy that has no rapture;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with the joy that has no rapture.

 As in a pond of white lotuses
 or a pond of red lotuses
 or a pond of blue lotuses,
 some white lotuses
 or red lotuses
 or blue lotuses
 are born in the water,
 grow up in the water,
 never rising above the surface
 but flourishing beneath it  these from their roots to their tips
 are drenched,
 saturated,
 permeated,
 suffused
 by cool water.

 Even so, Udāyin, a monk
 drenches,
 saturates,
 permeates,
 suffuses
 this very body
 with the joy that has no rapture;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with the joy that has no rapture.

 And again, Udāyin, a monk
 by getting rid of joy
 and by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down
 of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 He, having suffused this very body
 with a mind that is [217] utterly pure,
 utterly clean,
 comes to be sitting down;
 there [332] is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused
 with a mind that is utterly pure,
 utterly clean.
 Udāyin, as a monk might be sitting down
 who has clothed himself
 including his head
 with a white cloth,
 no part of his whole body
 would not be suffused
 with the white cloth.

 Even so, Udāyin, a monk,
 having suffused this very body
 with a mind that is utterly pure,
 utterly clean,
 comes to be sitting down;
 there is no part of his whole body
 that is not suffused by a mind
 that is utterly pure,
 utterly clean.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine comprehend thus:

 'This body of mine,
 having material shape,
 made of the four great elements,
 originated from mother and father,
 nourished on gruel and sour milk,
 is of a nature to be constantly rubbed away,
 pounded away,
 broken up
 and scattered,[41]
 but this consciousness of mine is fastened there,
 bound there.[42]

 Udāyin, as an emerald jewel,[43]
 of lovely water,
 well cut into eight facets,
 translucent,
 flawless,
 having all good qualities,
 might be strung on a thread,
 blue-green
 or yellow
 or red
 or white
 or orange-coloured;
 and a man with vision,
 having put it in his hand,
 might reflect:

 'This emerald jewel
 of lovely water,
 well cut into eight facets,
 translucent,
 flawless,
 having all good qualities,
 might be strung on a thread,
 blue-green
 or yellow
 or red
 or white
 or orange-coloured.'
 Even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine know[44] thus:

 'This body of mine,
 having material shape,
 made of the four great elements,
 originated from mother and father,
 nourished on gruel and sour milk,
 is of a nature to be constantly rubbed away,
 pounded away,
 broken up
 and scattered,
 but this consciousness[45] of mine is fastened there,
 bound there.'

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 from this body
 (mentally) produce (another) body,
 having material shape,
 mind-made,[46]
 having all its major and minor parts,
 not deficient in any sense-organ.[47]
 As, Udāyin,
 a man might draw an arrow from a reed[48]
 and might think [218] thus:

 'This is the reed,
 this the arrow,
 the reed is one thing,
 the arrow another;
 it is from the reed
 that the arrow has been drawn';

 or again, Udāyin,
 as a man might draw a sword from the scabbard
 and might think thus:

 'This is the sword,
 this the scabbard,
 the sword is one thing,
 the scabbard another;
 it is from the scabbard
 that the sword has been drawn';

 or again, Udāyin,
 as a man might take a snake out of the slough
 and might think thus:

 'This is the snake,
 this the slough,
 the snake is one thing,
 the slough another;
 it is from the slough
 that the snake has been taken out.'

 Even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which my disciples
 from this body
 (mentally) produce (another) body,
 having material shape,
 mind-made,
 having all its major and minor parts,
 not deficient in any sense-organ.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 experience the various forms of psychic power;[49]

 having been one they become manifold;
 having been manifold they become one;

 manifest or invisible
 they go unhindered through a wall,
 through a rampart,
 through a mountain
 as if through air;

 they plunge into the ground
 and up again
 as if in water;

 they walk upon the water
 without parting it
 as if on the ground;

 sitting cross-legged
 they travel through the air
 like a bird on the wing;

 and with their hands
 they rub and stroke this moon and sun
 which are of such power and majesty,

 and even as far as the Brahma-world
 they have power with the person.

 As, Udāyin,
 a skilled potter
 or potter's apprentice
 from properly prepared clay
 could make whatever shaped clay vessel he wished;

 or as a skilled ivory-worker
 or ivory-worker's apprentice
 from properly prepared ivory
 could make whatever shaped ivory vessel he wished;

 or as a skilled goldsmith
 or goldsmith's apprentice
 from properly prepared gold
 could make whatever shaped gold vessel he wished
 even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 experience the various forms of psychic power experience the various forms of psychic power;

 having been one they become manifold;
 having been manifold they become one;
 manifest or invisible
 they go unhindered through a wall,
 through a rampart,
 through a mountain
 as if through air;

 they plunge into the ground
 and up again
 as if in water;

 they walk upon the water
 without parting it
 as if on the ground;

 sitting cross-legged
 they travel through the air
 like a bird on the wing;

 and with their hands
 they rub and stroke this moon and sun
 which are of such power and majesty,

 and even as far as the Brahma-world

 [219] they have power with the person.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 through the purified deva-element of hearing
 surpassing that of men,
 hear both sounds;
 the deva-like and the human,
 those that are distant
 and those that are near.

 As, Udāyin,
 a powerful conch-blower could,
 without trouble,
 inform the four quarters,
 even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 through the purified deva-element of hearing
 surpassing that of men,
 hear both sounds;
 the deva-like and the human,
 those that are distant
 and those that are near.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 comprehend with the mind
 the minds of other beings,
 of other individuals;[50]

 they comprehend the mind with attachment
 as a mind with attachment;

 they comprehend the mind without attachment
 as a mind without attachment;

 they comprehend the mind with aversion
 as a mind with aversion;

 they comprehend the mind without aversion
 as a mind without aversion

 they comprehend the mind with confusion
 as a mind with confusion

 they comprehend the mind without confusion
 as a mind without confusion

 they comprehend the mind that is contracted
 as a mind that is contracted

 they comprehend the mind that is distracted
 as a mind that is distracted

 they comprehend the mind that has become great
 as a mind that has become great

 they comprehend the mind that has not become great
 as a mind that has not become great

 they comprehend the mind with (some other mental state) superior to it
 as a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it
 they comprehend the mind with no (other mental state) superior to it
 as a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it.

 they comprehend the mind that is composed
 as a mind that is composed

 they comprehend the mind that is not composed
 as a mind that is not composed

 they comprehend the mind that is freed
 as a mind that is freed

 they comprehend the mind that is not freed
 as a mind that is not freed.

 Udāyin, it is like a woman or a man,
 young and of tender years,
 fond of adornment,
 who,
 regarding the reflection
 of (her or his) own face
 in a perfectly pure and perfectly clean mirror
 or in a bowl of clear water
 would, if it had a mole on it,
 know that it had,
 and if not,
 would know that it had not.[51]

 Even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 comprehend with the [220] mind
 the mind of other beings,
 of other individuals;

 they comprehend the mind with attachment
 as a mind with attachment;
 they comprehend the mind without attachment
 as a mind without attachment;

 they comprehend the mind with aversion
 as a mind with aversion;

 they comprehend the mind without aversion
 as a mind without aversion

 they comprehend the mind with confusion
 as a mind with confusion

 they comprehend the mind without confusion
 as a mind without confusion

 they comprehend the mind that is contracted
 as a mind that is contracted

 they comprehend the mind that is distracted
 as a mind that is distracted

 they comprehend the mind that has become great
 as a mind that has become great

 they comprehend the mind that has not become great
 as a mind that has not become great

 they comprehend the mind with (some other mental state) superior to it
 as a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it

 they comprehend the mind with no (other mental state) superior to it
 as a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it.

 they comprehend the mind that is composed
 as a mind that is composed

 they comprehend the mind that is not composed
 as a mind that is not composed
 they comprehend the mind that is freed
 as a mind that is freed

 they comprehend the mind that is not freed
 as a mind that is not freed.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 recollect a variety of former habitations,[52] that is to say:

 one birth,
 two births,
 three births, four births, five births,
 ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 many an eon of integration,
 many an eon of disintegration,
 many an eon of integration-disintegration;
 such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.
 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this I arose here.

 Thus may I remember (my) divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail,'

 Udāyin, it is like[53] a man who might go from his own village
 to another village,
 and who from that village
 might go to another village
 and from that village
 might return to his own village.

 This might occur to him:

 'I went from my own village
 to a certain other village
 where I stood thus,
 sat down thus,
 spoke thus,
 was silent thus;
 and from that village
 I went to another village
 where too I stood thus,
 sat down thus,
 spoke thus,
 was silent thus;
 then from that village
 I returned to my own village.'

 Even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 recollect a variety of former habitations,
 that is to say:

 one birth,
 two births,
 three births, four births, five births,
 ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 many an eon of integration,
 many an eon of disintegration,
 many an eon of integration-disintegration;
 such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Thus may I remember (my) divers former habitations

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 see beings as they are passing hence
 and coming to be,[54]
 and they comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds
 and they think:

 Indeed these worthy beings
 were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they were scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds [221] consequent on a wrong view these,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who were not scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 see beings as they are passing hence
 and coming to be,
 and they comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds.

 It is as if,[55] Udāyin,
 there might be two houses with doors,
 and if a man with vision
 were standing there between them
 he might see people
 entering and leaving the houses,
 visiting
 and strolling about.

 Even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 see beings as they are passing hence
 and coming to be,
 and they comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds
 and they think:

 Indeed these worthy beings
 were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they were scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,

 a bad bourn,

 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings

 who were not scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these

 a heaven world.

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 see beings as they are passing hence
 and coming to be,
 and they comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 And again, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having realised here-now
 through their own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 enter and abide therein.

 Udāyin,
 it is like[55] a pure,
 limpid,
 serene pool of water where,
 if a man with vision
 were standing on the bank,
 he might see oysters
 and shells,
 and gravel
 and pebbles,
 and shoals of fish
 moving about
 and keeping still.

 It might occur to him:

 'This pool of water is pure,
 limpid,
 serene,
 here these oysters
 and shells,
 and the gravel
 and pebbles,
 and shoals of fish
 are moving about
 and keeping still.'

 Even so, Udāyin,
 a course has been pointed out by me for disciples,
 practising which disciples of mine
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having realised here-now
 through their own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 enter and abide therein.

 As to this, many of my disciples abide
 attained to accomplishment
 and to going beyond through super-knowledge.

 §

 This, Udāyin, is the fifth thing for which disciples of mine revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me and,
 revering and respecting,
 live in dependence.

 [222] These, Udāyin,
 are the five things for which disciples of mine
 revere,
 respect,
 esteem
 and honour me
 and, revering and respecting,
 live in dependence."

 Thus spoke the Lord.
 Delighted, the wanderer Sakuludāyin
 rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
