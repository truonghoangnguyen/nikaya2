# 62. Greater Discourse on an Exhortation to Rāhula

## Mahā-Rāhul'ovāda Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.

 The venerable Rāhula, [421] having also dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe followed close after the Lord.

 Then the Lord, having looked round, addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:

 "Whatever, Rāhula, is material shape, past, future, present, subjective or objective, gross or subtle, low or excellent, distant or near,
 all material shape should be seen as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom thus:
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.'"

 "Only material shape, Lord,
 only material shape, Wellfarer?"

 "Material shape, Rāhula,
 and feeling, Rāhula,
 and perception, Rāhula,
 and the habitual tendencies, Rāhula,
 and consciousness, Rāhula."

 Then the venerable Rāhula thought:

 "Who indeed today, when he has been exhorted with an exhortation face-to- face with the Lord, could enter a village for almsfood?"

 And turning back from there,
 he sat down cross-legged at the root of a tree,
 holding his back erect
 and arousing mindfulness in front of him.

 Then the venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Rāhula sitting down cross- legged at the root of the tree, holding his back erect and arousing mindfulness in front of him;
 and seeing him, he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:

 "Develop the (mind-) development[1] that is mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula.

 Mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula,
 if developed and made much of
 is of great fruit, of great advantage."
 Then the venerable [92] Rāhula, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening, approached the Lord;
 having approached, having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Rāhula spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, how if mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing is developed and made much of is it of great fruit, of great advantage?"

 "Whatever,[2] Rāhula, is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, that is to say:
 the hair of the head, the hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow of the bones, kidney, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement,
 or whatever other thing is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of extension.

 Whatever is an internal element of extension
 and whatever is an external element of extension,
 just these are the element of extension.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 [422] Having seen it thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of extension,
 he cleanses his thought of the element of extension.

 And what, Rāhula, is the liquid element?

 The liquid element may be internal, it may be external.
 And what, Rāhula, is the internal liquid element?

 Whatever is liquid, fluid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, that is to say:
 bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum, saliva, mucus, synovial fluid, urine
 or whatever other thing is liquid, fluid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 this, Rāhula, is called the internal liquid element.

 Whatever is an internal liquid element and whatever is an external liquid element, just these are the liquid element.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the liquid element,
 he cleanses his thought of the liquid element.

 And what, Rāhula, is the element of heat?

 The heat element may be internal, it may be external.

 And what, Rāhula, is the [93] internal heat element?

 Whatever is heat, warmth, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 such as by whatever one is vitalised, by whatever one is consumed, by whatever one is burnt up, and by whatever one has munched, drunk, eaten and tasted that is properly transformed (in digestion),
 or whatever other thing is heat, warmth, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 this, Rāhula, is called the internal heat element.
 Whatever is an internal element of heat and whatever is an external element of heat,
 just these are the element of heat.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the heat element,
 he cleanses his thought of the heat element.

 And what, Rāhula, is the element of motion?

 The element of motion may be internal, it may be external.

 And what, Rāhula, is the internal element of motion?

 Whatever is motion, wind, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 such as winds going upwards, winds going downwards, winds in the abdomen, winds in the belly, winds that shoot across the several limbs, in- breathing, out-breathing,
 or whatever other thing is motion, wind, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of motion.

 Whatever is an internal element of motion and whatever is an external element of motion, just these are the element of motion.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.
 Having seen this thus as it really is [423] by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of motion,
 he cleanses his thought of the element of motion.

 And what, Rahlda, is the element of space?[3]

 The element of space may be internal, it may be external.

 And what, Rāhula, is the internal element of space?

 Whatever is space, spacious, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 such as the auditory and nasal orifices, the door of the mouth and that by which one swallows what is munched, drunk, eaten and tasted, and where this remains, and where it passes out of (the body) lower down,
 or whatever other thing is space, spacious, is internal, referable to an [94] individual and derived therefrom,
 this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of space.

 Whatever is an internal element of space and whatever is an external element of space, just these are the element of space.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of space,
 he cleanses his thought of the element of space.

 Develop the (mind-) development that is like the earth,[4] Rāhula.

 For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like the earth, Rāhula,
 agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen,
 taking hold of your thought,
 will not persist.

 As, Rāhula, people cast what is clean on to the earth and what is unclean and, ordure and urine and spittle and pus and blood,
 and yet the earth is not troubled thereby nor worried or disgusted,
 even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like the earth.

 taking hold of your thought,
 will not persist.

 Develop the (mind-) development that is like water, Rāhula.

 For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like water, Rāhula,

 As, Rāhula, people wash what is clean in water and what is unclean and wash away ordure and urine and spittle and pus and blood,
 and yet the water is not troubled thereby nor worried or disgusted,

 For, from developing ...

 Develop the (mind-) development that is like fire,[5] Rāhula.

 For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like fire, Rāhula,

 even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like air.

 For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like air, Rāhula,
 agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen,
 taking hold of your thought,
 will not persist.[6]

 [425] For, from developing the (mind-) development that is perception of impermanence, Rāhula,
 that which is the conceit, 'I am'[10] will be got rid of.

 Develop the (mind-) development that is mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula.
 Mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula,
 is of great fruit, of great advantage.

 And how, Rāhula, if mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing is developed,
 how, if it is made much of,
 is it of great fruit, of great advantage?

 As to this, Rāhula, a monk who is-forest-gone[11]
 or gone to the root of a tree
 or gone to an empty place,
 sits down cross-legged,
 holding his back erect,
 arousing mindfulness in front of him.

 Mindful he breathes in,
 mindful he breathes out.

 Breathing in a long (breath) he comprehends,
 'I am breathing in a long (breath)';
 or breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends,
 'I am breathing out a long (breath)';
 or breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends,
 'I am breathing in a short (breath)';
 or breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends,
 'I am breathing out a short (breath).'

 He trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body';
 he trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'
 He trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body';
 he trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.'
 He trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe in experiencing rapture';
 he trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe out experiencing rapture.'
 He trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe in ... out experiencing happiness
 ... shall breathe in ... out experiencing the activity of thought ...
 tranquillising the activity of thought ...
 experiencing thought ...
 rejoicing in thought ...
 concentrating thought ...
 freeing thought.'

 He trains himself thinking:
 'I shall breathe in ... out beholding impermanence
 ... beholding dispassion
 ... beholding stopping
 ... beholding casting away.'

 [97] Mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing if developed thus, Rāhula,
 if made much of thus,
 is of great fruit, of great advantage.

 When, Rāhula, mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing has been developed thus,

 [426] has been made much of thus,
 then those which are the last in-breaths and out-breaths are also stopped
 only when they are known,
 not when they are unknown."[12]

 Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, the venerable Rāhula rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
