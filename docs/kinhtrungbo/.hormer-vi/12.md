# 12. Greater Discourse on the Lion's Roar

## Mahā Sīhanāda Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Vesālī
 outside the town
 in a woodland thicket to the west.[1]

 Now at that time Sunakkhatta,
 the son of a Licchavi,[2]
 having recently left this dhamma and discipline,
 spoke these words to a group (of people) at Vesālī:

 "There are no states of further-men,[3]
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight[4] befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system) of his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation;[5]
 and says that dhamma,
 taught for the sake of something specific,[6]
 leads onwards[7] the doer of it
 to the complete destruction of anguish."

 Then the venerable Sāriputta,
 having dressed early in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Vesālī for almsfood.

 Then the venerable Sāriputta heard that speech of Sunakkhatta,
 the son of a Licchavi,
 as it was being spoken to the group (of people) in Vesālī:

 "There are no states of further-men,
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system) of his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation;
 and says that dhamma,
 taught for the sake of something specific,
 leads onwards [92] the doer of it
 to the complete destruction of anguish."

 Then the venerable Sāriputta, having walked in Vesālī for almsfood,
 after the meal
 returning from (his quest for[8]) alms,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Lord, Sunakkhatta, the son of a Licchavi,
 spoke these words to a group (of people) at Vesālī:

 'There are no states of further-men,
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system) of his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation;
 and says that dhamma,
 taught for the sake of something specific,
 leads onwards the doer of it
 to the complete destruction of anguish.'

 "Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly,
 and these words were spoken by him in wrath.

 Thinking,

 'I will speak dispraise,'

 he, Sāriputta,
 the foolish man Sunakkhatta,
 really spoke praise of the Tathāgata.

 For this, Sāriputta, is praise of a Tathāgata:
 when someone should speak thus:

 'Dhamma, taught for the sake of something specific,
 leads onwards the doer of it
 to the complete destruction of anguish.'
 But, Sāriputta, there will not be for Sunakkhatta,
 the foolish man,
 this inference from dhamma about me:

 'This is the Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-awakened One,
 endowed with knowledge and right conduct,
 well-farer,
 knower of the world(s),
 incomparable trainer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and men,
 the Awakened one, the Lord.'

 §

 Nor, Sāriputta, will there be for Sunakkhatta,
 the foolish man,
 this inference from dhamma about me:

 'This is the Lord who enjoys the manifold forms of psychic power:

 From having been one he becomes manifold;
 from having been manifold
 he becomes one;
 manifest or invisible,
 he goes unhindered through a wall,
 through a rampart,
 through a mountain
 as if through air;
 he plunges into the ground
 and shoots up again
 as if in water;
 he walks upon the water
 without parting it
 as if on the ground;
 sitting cross-legged
 he travels through the air
 like a bird on the wing.

 Even this moon and sun,
 although of such mighty power and majesty,
 he rubs and strokes them
 with his hand.

 Even as far as the Brahma-world
 he has power in respect of his body.'

 §

 Nor, Sāriputta, will there be for Sunakkhatta,
 the foolish man,

 [93] this inference from dhamma about me:

 'This is the Lord who,
 through the purified deva-condition of hearing,
 surpassing that of men,
 hears both (kinds of) sounds:
 deva-like ones and human ones,
 and those which are distant
 and those which are near.'

 §
 Nor, Sāriputta, will there be for Sunakkhatta,
 the foolish man,
 this inference from dhamma about me:

 'This is the Lord who knows intuitively by mind
 the minds of other beings,
 of other individuals;

 He knows intuitively
 of a mind that is full of attachment
 that it is full of attachment;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is without attachment
 that it is without attachment;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is full of aversion
 that it is full of aversion;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is full of confusion
 that it is full of confusion;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is without aversion
 that it is without aversion;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is contracted
 that it is contracted;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is distracted
 that it is distracted;
 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that has become great
 that it has become great;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that has not become great
 that it has not become great;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it
 that it is a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it
 that it is a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is composed
 that it is composed;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is not composed
 that it is not composed;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is freed
 that it is freed;

 he knows intuitively
 of a mind that is not freed
 that it is not freed.'
 Now, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata has these ten powers of a Tathāgata,[9]
 endowed with which powers
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,[10]
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.[11]

 What are the ten?

 Herein, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 causal occasion as such
 and what is not causal occasion as such.[12]

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 causal occasion as such
 and what is not causal occasion as such,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the [94] acquiring of deeds for oneself,
 past, future and present,
 both in their causal occasion
 and their result.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is

 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the course[13] leading to all bourns.[14]

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the course leading to all bourns,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the world[15]
 with its various and diverse features.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the world
 with its various and diverse features
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as they really are
 the divers characters of beings.[16]

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata also comprehends as they really are
 the divers characters of beings,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the higher or lower state
 of the faculties[17]
 of other beings,
 of other persons.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is
 the higher or lower state
 of the faculties
 of other beings,
 of other persons,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as they really are
 the defilement of,
 the purification of,
 the emergence from
 attainments in meditation,
 the deliverances
 and concentration.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as they really are
 the defilement of,
 the purification of,
 the emergence from
 attainments in meditation,
 the deliverances
 and concentration,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.
 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata remembers his manifold former habitations,
 that is to say:

 One birth,
 and two births,
 three, four, five,
 ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,
 a hundred,
 a thousand births,
 and a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration,
 and many an eon of disintegration,
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration, thinking:

 'Such and such was I by name,
 having such a clan,
 such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 I experienced this and that pleasure and pain,
 so did the span of life end.

 As that one I,
 passing from this,
 rose up again elsewhere.

 There, too, such a one was I by name,
 having such a clan,
 such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 experienced this or that pleasure and pain,
 so did the span of life end.
 I, deceasing thence,
 rose up here.'

 Thus with all their modes and detail,
 does [95] he remember his manifold former habitations.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata remembers his manifold former habitations,
 that is to say:

 One birth,
 and two births,
 three, four, five,
 ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,
 a hundred,
 a thousand births,
 and a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration,
 and many an eon of disintegration,
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration, thinking:

 'Such and such was I by name,

 and thus with all their modes and detail,
 he remember his manifold former habitations,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata,
 with his purified deva vision,
 surpassing that of men,
 sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising  he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of their deeds,
 and thinks:

 'Indeed, these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 in speech,
 in thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 of wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 arise in the sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But, on the other hand,
 these worthy beings,
 endowed with good conduct in body,
 speech,
 and thought,
 not scoffers at the ariyans,
 of right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on right view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arise in a good bourn,
 the heaven world.'

 In this way,
 with his purified deva vision,
 surpassing that of men,
 he sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going according to their deeds.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata,
 with his purified deva vision,
 surpassing that of men,
 sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of their deeds,
 and thinks:

 'Indeed, these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 in speech,
 in thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 of wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 arise in the sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But, on the other hand,
 these worthy beings,
 endowed with good conduct in body,
 speech,
 and thought,
 not scoffers at the ariyans,
 of right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on right view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arise in a good bourn,
 the heaven world.'

 In this way,
 with his purified deva vision,
 surpassing that of men,
 he sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going according to their deeds,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 §

 And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 enters on
 and abides in freedom of mind,
 freedom through wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 having realised them here and now
 through his own super-knowledge.

 Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 enters on
 and abides in freedom of mind,
 freedom through wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 having realised them here and now
 through his own super-knowledge,
 this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata's power of a Tathāgata,
 having which power
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 These, Sāriputta,
 are the Tathāgata's
 ten powers of a Tathāgata,
 endowed with which powers
 the Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus,
 seeing me thus,
 should speak thus:

 'There are no states of further-men,
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight
 befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system of) his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation'
 if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta,
 if he does not retract [96] that thought,
 if he does not give up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.[18]

 Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit,
 endowed with concentration,
 endowed with intuitive wisdom,
 might attain profound knowledge here-now,
 so I say that this, Sāriputta,
 results thus:[19]

 Not retracting that speech,
 not retracting that thought,
 not giving up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.

 Sāriputta, there are these four convictions[20] of a Tathāgata
 endowed with which convictions
 a Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 What are the four?

 If anyone says:

 'These matters are not fully awakened to
 although you claim to be fully self-awakened'

 -as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta,
 on which a recluse or a brahman
 or a deva or Mara or Brahma
 or anyone in the world
 can legitimately reprove me.

 Because I, Sāriputta,
 do not behold this ground,
 I fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 If anyone says:

 'These cankers are not utterly destroyed,
 although you claim to be one
 whose cankers are destroyed,'

 -as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta,
 on which a recluse or a brahman
 or a deva or Mara or Brahma
 or anyone in the world
 can legitimately reprove me.

 If anyone says:

 'In following those things called stumbling-blocks
 there is no stumbling-block at all,'[21]

 -as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta,
 on which a recluse or a brahman
 or a deva or Mara or Brahma
 or anyone in the world
 can legitimately reprove me.

 If anyone says:

 'Dhamma, taught by you
 for the sake of something specific,
 does not lead onward the doer of it
 to the complete destruction of anguish,'

 -as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta,
 on which a recluse or a brahman
 or a deva or Mara or Brahma
 or anyone in the world
 can legitimately reprove me.

 These, Sāriputta,
 are the four convictions of a Tathāgata,
 endowed [97] with which convictions
 the Tathāgata claims the leader's place,
 roars his lion's roar in assemblies,
 and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.

 Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus,
 seeing me thus,
 should speak thus:

 'There are no states of further-men,
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight
 befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system of) his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation'
 if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta,
 if he does not retract that thought,
 if he does not give up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.

 Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit,
 endowed with concentration,
 endowed with intuitive wisdom,
 might attain profound knowledge here-now,
 so I say that this, Sāriputta,
 results thus:
 Not retracting that speech,
 not retracting that thought,
 not giving up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.

 These, Sāriputta, are the eight (kinds of) assemblies.[22]

 What are the eight?

 Assemblies of nobles,
 assemblies of brahmans,
 assemblies of householders,
 assemblies of recluses,
 assemblies of the retinue of the Four Great Regents,
 assemblies of the Thirty-Three,
 Māra's assemblies,[23]
 assemblies of Brahmas.

 These eight, Sāriputta, are the assemblies.

 §

 A Tathāgata who is endowed with those four convictions, Sāriputta,
 approaches these eight assemblies,
 enters them.
 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of nobles[24].

 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there
 and before I fell into conversation there,
 I did not behold, Sāriputta,
 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of brahmans.

 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there
 and before I fell into conversation there,

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.
 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,

 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there

 I did not behold, Sāriputta,
 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of recluses.

 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there
 and before I fell into conversation there,
 I did not behold, Sāriputta,
 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.
 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies
 of the retinue of the Four Great Regents.

 Yet before I sat down there

 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of the Thirty-Three.
 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there
 and before I fell into conversation there,
 I did not behold, Sāriputta,
 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred of Mara's assemblies.

 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there
 and before I fell into conversation there,
 I did not behold, Sāriputta,
 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.
 §

 Now I, Sāriputta,
 call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of Brahmas.

 Yet before I sat down there
 and before I held converse there
 and before I fell into conversation there,
 I did not behold, Sāriputta,
 any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness
 would come upon me there.

 So I, Sāriputta,
 not beholding this ground,
 fare along attained to security,
 attained to fearlessness,
 attained to conviction.

 Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus,
 seeing me thus,
 should speak thus:

 'There are no states of further-men,
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight
 befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system of) his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning

 if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta,
 if he does not retract that thought,
 if he does not give up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.
 Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit,
 endowed with concentration,
 endowed with intuitive wisdom,
 might attain profound knowledge here-now,
 so I say that this, Sāriputta,
 results thus:

 Not retracting that speech,
 not retracting that thought,
 not giving up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.

 These, Sāriputta, are the four modes of life.[25]

 What are the four?

 The mode of life born from an egg,
 the mode of life born from a womb,
 the mode of life born from moisture,
 the mode of life of spontaneous uprising.[26]

 §

 And what, Sāriputta,
 is the mode of life born from an egg?
 Whatever beings are produced, Sāriputta,
 breaking through an egg-shell,
 this, Sāriputta, is called
 the mode of life born from an egg.

 §

 And what, Sāriputta,
 is the mode of life born from a womb?

 Whatever beings are produced, Sāriputta,
 breaking through a membranous sheath,
 this, Sāriputta,
 is called the mode of life born from a womb.

 §

 And what, Sāriputta,
 is the [98] mode of life born of moisture?

 Whatever beings are produced, Sāriputta,
 in rotting fish
 or in rotting corpses
 or rotting rice
 or in a dirty pool near a village,
 this, Sāriputta, is called
 the mode of life born of moisture.
 §

 And what, Sāriputta, is the mode of life
 of spontaneous uprising?

 Devas,[27]
 those in Niraya Hell,
 and some men
 and some in the sorrowful state  this is called, Sāriputta,
 the mode of life of spontaneous uprising.

 These, Sāriputta, are the four modes of life.

 §[ed1]

 [34.] These, Sāriputta, are the five bourns.[28]

 What are the five?

 Niraya Hell,
 animal birth,
 the realm of the departed,[29]
 men,
 devas.

 §
 I, Sāriputta, comprehend Niraya Hell
 and the way[30] leading to Niraya Hell
 and the course[30] leading to Niraya Hell,
 and that according to how one is faring along
 one uprises,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell  that too I comprehend.

 §

 And I, Sāriputta, comprehend animal birth
 and the way leading to animal birth
 and the course leading to animal birth,
 and that according to how one is faring along
 one uprises,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 in animal birth  that too I comprehend.

 §

 And I, Sāriputta, comprehend the realm of the departed
 and the way leading to the realm of the departed
 and the course leading to the realm of the departed,
 and that according to how one is faring along
 one uprises,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 in the realm of the departed  that too I comprehend.

 §

 And I, Sāriputta, comprehend men,
 and the way leading to the world of men
 and the course leading to the world of men,
 and that according to how one is faring along
 one uprises,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 among men  that too I comprehend.

 §

 And I, Sāriputta, comprehend devas
 and the way leading to deva-worlds
 and the course leading to deva-worlds,
 and that according to how one is faring along
 one uprises,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 in a good [99] bourn, a heaven-world-that too I comprehend.

 §
 And I, Sāriputta, comprehend nibbāna[31]
 and the way leading to nibbāna
 and the course leading to nibbāna,
 and that according to how one is faring along,
 by the destruction of the cankers
 one enters on
 and abides in
 the freedom of mind,
 the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 which are cankerless,
 having realised them here-now
 by one's own super-knowledge  that too I comprehend.

 §

 Now I, Sāriputta, with my mind
 comprehend the mind of some person thus:

 As that person fares along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered that way,
 so will he arise
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 After a time I see
 by purified deva vision,
 surpassing that of men
 that, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 he has arisen in a sorrowful state,va bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell,
 and is experiencing feelings that are exclusively[32] painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 Sāriputta, it is as if there were a pit of charcoal,
 deeper than man's height,
 full of embers
 that are neither flaming nor smoking;[33]
 then a man might come along
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched and thirsty,[34]
 heading direct for that pit of charcoal itself
 by the one sole way.

 A man with vision,
 having seen him,
 might say:

 'As that good man is faring along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he come to that pit of charcoal itself.'

 After a time he may see him,
 fallen into that charcoal pit,
 experiencing feelings that are exclusively painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind
 comprehend the mind of some person thus:
 As that person fares along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he arise
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 After a time I see
 by purified deva vision,
 surpassing that of men,
 that, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 he has arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell,
 and is experiencing feelings
 that are exclusively painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 Sāriputta, it is as if there were a cesspool,
 deeper than a man's height,
 full of filth;
 then a man might come along
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched and thirsty,
 heading direct for that cesspool itself
 by the one sole way.

 Sāriputta, it is like a tree
 growing on uneven ground,
 with sparse leaves and foliage
 (giving) patchy shade.[37]

 Then a man might come along
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched

 a heaven world.

 surpassing that of men,
 that, at the breaking up of the body after dying,

 Sāriputta, it is as if there were a long house[39]
 where there might be a building with a gabled roof,
 smeared inside and out,[40]
 protected from the wind,
 with bolts that are fastened,[41]
 windows[42] that are closed.[43]

 Therein might be a divan[44]
 spread with a long-haired coverlet,[45]
 spread with a white coverlet,
 spread with a wool coverlet
 bespread with flowers,
 a splendid sheeting
 of the hide of the kadali-deer,
 with an awning overhead
 and a scarlet cushion at either end.[46]

 Then a man might come along
 overcome
 and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched,
 thirsty,
 heading direct for that long house itself
 by the one sole way.

 A man with vision,
 having seen him,
 might say:

 'As that good [102] man is faring along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he come to that long house itself.'

 After a time
 he may see him sitting down
 or lying down
 in that long house,
 in that building with the gabled roof,
 on that divan,
 experiencing feelings

 comprehend of some person thus:

 As that person fares along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he arise,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 in a good bourn,

 surpassing that of men,

 §
 [40.] Then I, Sāriputta, with my mind
 comprehend the mind of some person thus:

 As that person fares along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 enter and abide
 in the freedom of mind,
 the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 having realised them here-now
 by his own super-knowledge.

 After a time I see that he,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having entered on freedom of mind,
 freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 and having realised them here-now
 by his own super-knowledge,
 is abiding in them,
 experiencing feelings
 that are exclusively pleasant.[47]

 Sāriputta, it is as if there were a lovely lotus-pool[48]
 with clear water,
 sweet water,
 cool water,
 limpid,
 with beautiful banks,[49]
 and close to it
 a dim forest thicket.
 Then a man might come along
 overcome
 and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched
 and thirsty,
 heading direct for that pond itself
 by the one sole way.

 A man with vision,
 having seen him,
 might say:

 'As that good man is faring along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he come to that lotus-pool itself.'

 After a time he may see that he
 has plunged into that lotus-pool,
 has bathed in it
 and drunk of it,
 and having allayed all distress,
 exhaustion
 and fever,
 has got out again[50]
 and is sitting down
 or lying down
 in that forest thicket[51]
 experiencing feelings
 that are exclusively pleasant.

 Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind
 comprehend the mind
 of some person thus:
 As that person is faring along
 and as he is going along
 and has entered on that way,
 so will he,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having entered on freedom of mind,
 freedom through [103] intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 having realised them here-now
 by his own super-knowledge,
 abide therein.

 After a time I see that he,
 by the destruction of the cankers,
 having entered on freedom of mind,
 freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 having realised them here-now
 by his own super-knowledge,
 is abiding therein,
 experiencing feelings
 that are exclusively pleasant.

 These, Sāriputta, are the five bourns.

 Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus,
 seeing me thus,
 should speak thus:

 'There are no states of further-men,
 (no) excellent knowledge and insight
 befitting the ariyans
 in the recluse Gotama;
 the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma
 on (a system of) his own devising
 beaten out by reasoning
 and based on investigation'
 if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta,
 if he does not retract that thought,
 if he does not give up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.

 Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit,
 endowed with concentration,
 endowed with intuitive wisdom,
 might attain profound knowledge here-now,
 so I say that this, Sāriputta,
 results thus:

 Not retracting that speech,
 not retracting that thought,
 not giving up that view,
 he is consigned to Niraya Hell
 just as a burden is set aside.

 Now I, Sāriputta, as one who fares,
 fully know a Brahma-faring[52]
 that is endowed with four constituent parts:[53]

 I became an ascetic,
 the foremost ascetic;
 I became loathly,
 the foremost loathly one;
 I became a detester,[54] the foremost detester;
 I became aloof,
 the foremost aloof one.
 In that,[55] Sāriputta,
 there was this for me
 through asceticism:

 I was unclothed,[56]
 flouting life's decencies,[57]
 licking my hands (after [104] meals),
 not one to come when asked to do so,
 not one to stand still when asked to do so.[58]

 I did not consent (to accept food) offered to (me)
 or specially prepared for (me)
 nor to (accept) an invitation (to a meal).

 I did not accept
 (food) straight from a cooking pot or pan,
 nor within the threshould,
 nor among the faggots,
 nor among the rice-pounders,[59]
 nor when two people were eating,[60]
 nor from a pregnant woman,
 nor from one giving suck,[61]
 nor from one co-habiting with a man,[62]
 nor from gleanings,[63]
 nor near where a dog is standing,
 nor where flies are swarming,
 nor fish,
 nor meat.

 I drank neither fermented liquor
 nor spirits
 nor rice-gruel.

 I was a one-house-man,
 a one-piece-man,[64]
 or a two-house-man,
 a two-piece-man
 or a three-house-man,
 a three-piece-man
 or a four-house-man,
 a four-piece-man
 or a five-house-man,
 a five-piece-man
 or a six-house-man,
 a six-piece-man
 or a seven-house-man,
 a seven-piece-man.

 I subsisted on one little offering,[65]
 and I subsisted on two little offerings
 and I subsisted on three little offerings
 and I subsisted on four little offerings
 and I subsisted on five little offerings
 and I subsisted on six little offerings
 and I subsisted on seven little offerings.

 I took food only once a day,
 and once in two days
 and once in three days
 and once in four days
 and once in five days
 and once in six days
 and once in seven days.

 Then I lived intent on the practice
 of eating rice at regular fort-nightly intervals.

 I came to be one feeding on[66] potherbs
 or feeding on millet
 or on wild rice
 or on snippets of skin
 or on water-plants
 or on the red powder of rice husks
 or on the discarded scum of rice on the boil
 or on the flour of oil-seeds
 or grass
 or cowdung.

 I was one who subsisted
 on forest roots and fruits,
 eating the fruits that had fallen.

 I wore coarse hempen cloths,[67]
 and I wore mixed cloths,[68]
 and I wore cerements,
 and I wore rags taken from the dust heap,
 and I wore tree-bark fibre,
 and I wore antelope skins,
 and I wore strips of antelope skin,
 and I wore cloths of kusa-grass,
 and I wore cloths of bark,
 and I wore cloths of wood shavings,
 and I wore [105] a blanket of human hair,
 and I wore a blanket of animal hair,
 and I wore owls' feathers.

 I was one who plucked out
 the hair of his head and beard,
 intent on the practice of plucking out
 the hair of head and beard.

 I became one who stood upright,
 refusing a seat;
 I became one who squats on his haunches,
 intent on the practice of squatting.

 I became one for covered thorns,[69]
 I made my bed on covered thorns;
 and I was intent on the practice
 of going down to the water to bathe
 up to three times in an evening.[70]

 Thus in many a way
 did I live intent on the practice
 of mortifying
 and tormenting my body.

 This then was for me, Sāriputta,
 through asceticism.

 §

 In that, Sāriputta,
 there was this for me through loathliness:

 On my body there accumulated
 the dust and dirt of years,
 so that it fell off in shreds.

 Just as the stump of the tindukā-tree
 comes to accumulate the dust and dirt of years,
 so that it falls off in shreds,
 even so, Sāriputta, on my body
 there accumulated the dust and dirt of years,
 so that it fell off in shreds.

 But it did not occur to me, Sāriputta, to think:

 'Indeed now, I could rub off this dust and dirt
 with my hand,
 or others could rub off this dust and dirt for me
 with their hands.'

 It did not occur to me thus, Sāriputta.

 This then was for me, Sāriputta,
 through loathliness.

 §

 In that, Sāriputta,
 there was this for me through detesting:

 Sāriputta, whether I was going out,
 whether I was returning,
 there was set up in me
 kindliness even towards a drop of water,
 and I thought:

 'Do not let me bring small creatures
 in their various places[71]
 to destruction.'

 This then was for me, Sāriputta,
 through detesting.

 §

 In that, Sāriputta,
 there was this for me through aloofness:
 If I had plunged into a certain stretch of forest,[72]
 and if I saw a cow-herd
 or a cattle-herd
 or a gatherer of grass or sticks
 or anyone roaming about for bulbs and roots and so on,[73]
 I fled from grove to grove,
 from thicket to thicket,
 from low ground to low ground,
 from high ground to high ground.

 What was the reason for this?

 [106] I thought:

 'Do not let them see me,
 do not let me see them.'[74]

 Even as a deer in the forest, Sāriputta,
 having seen a man,
 flees from grove to grove,
 from thicket to thicket,
 from low ground to low ground,
 from high ground to high ground,
 even so did I, Sāriputta,
 when I saw a cow-herd
 or a cattle-herd
 or a gatherer of grass or sticks
 or anyone roaming about for bulbs and roots and so on,
 flee from grove to grove,
 from thicket to thicket,
 from low ground to low ground,
 from high ground to high ground.

 What was the reason for this?

 I thought:
 'Do not let them see me,
 do not let me see them.'

 This then was for me, Sāriputta,
 through aloofness.

 §

 Then I, Sāriputta,
 having approached on all fours
 those cow-pens that the cows had quitted,
 the cow-herds having departed,[75]
 I subsisted there on the droppings
 of the young suckling calves.

 So long as my own dung and urine held out,
 I subsisted on that.

 This then was for me, Sāriputta,
 through partaking of the great filthy things.[76]

 §

 Then I, Sāriputta,
 having plunged into a terrifying forest thicket,
 stayed there.

 It comes to be said
 of a terrifying forest thicket,
 because it is so terrifying;

 'Whoever, not rid of attachment,
 enters that forest thicket,
 his hair stands on end.'

 Then I, Sāriputta,
 during the cold winter nights,
 between the 'eights'
 in a time of snowfall,[77]
 spent such nights as these
 in the open air,
 the days in the forest thicket.

 I spent the days
 of the last month of the hot weather
 in the open air,
 the nights
 in the forest thicket.[78]

 Then, Sāriputta,
 this verse,
 never heard before,
 occurred spontaneously to me:

 Now scorched, now cold, alone in terrifying forest,
 Naked and sitting fireless, the sage is intent on his quest.[79]

 Then I, Sāriputta,
 lay down to sleep in a cemetery,
 leaning on a skeleton.[80]

 Cowherds' boys,[81]
 having come up to me,
 spat and staled on me,
 and showered me with dust
 and stuck twigs into my [107] ears.

 But I, Sāriputta, well know
 that I was not the creator
 of a malign heart against them.[82]

 This then came to be for me, Sāriputta,
 through abiding in even-mindedness.[83]

 §

 There are, Sāriputta,
 some recluses and brahmans who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through food.'

 These speak thus:

 'We subsist on jujube fruits,'

 and they eat jujube fruits
 and they eat crushed jujube fruits
 and they drink jujube fruit water,
 and they make use of jujube fruits
 in a variety of ways.[84]

 Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted
 on one single jujube fruit.

 It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you:
 'But at that time
 the jujube fruit was large.'

 But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta,
 for the jujube fruit was then as it is now.

 While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single jujube fruit,
 my body became exceedingly emaciated.[85]

 Because I ate so little,
 all my limbs became like the knotted joints of withered creepers;
 because I ate so little,
 my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof;
 because I ate so little,
 my protruding backbone
 became like a string of balls;
 because I ate so little,
 my gaunt ribs
 became like the crazy rafters
 of a tumble-down shed;
 because I ate so little,
 the pupils of my eyes
 appeared lying low and deep in their sockets
 as sparkles of water
 in a deep well
 appear lying low and deep;
 because I ate so little,
 my scalp became shrivelled
 and shrunk
 as a bitter white gourd
 cut before it is ripe
 becomes shrivelled and shrunk
 by a hot wind.

 If I, Sāriputta, thought:
 'I will touch the skin of my belly,'

 it was my backbone
 that I took hold of.

 If I thought:

 'I will touch my backbone,'

 it was the skin of my belly
 that I took hold of.

 For because I ate so little,
 the skin on my belly, Sāriputta,
 came to be cleaving to my backbone.

 If I, Sāriputta, thought:

 'I will obey the calls of nature,'

 I fell down on my face then and there,
 because I ate so little.

 If I, Sāriputta,
 soothing my body,
 stroked my limbs with my hand,
 the hairs,
 rotted at the roots,
 fell away from my body
 as I stroked my limbs with my hand,
 because I ate so little.

 §
 There are, Sāriputta,
 some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through food.'

 These speak thus:

 'We subsist on beans,'

 and they eat beans
 and they eat crushed beans
 and they drink bean water,
 and they make use of beans
 in a variety of ways.

 Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted
 on one single bean.

 It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you:

 'But at that time
 the bean was large.'

 But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta,
 for the bean was then as it is now.

 While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single bean,
 my body became exceedingly emaciated.

 §

 There are, Sāriputta,
 some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through food.'

 These speak thus:

 We subsist on sesamum,'

 and they eat sesamum
 and they eat crushed sesamum
 and they drink sesamum water,
 and they make use of sesamum
 in a variety of ways.

 Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted
 on one single sesamum.

 It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you:

 'But at that time
 the sesamum was large.'

 But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta,
 for the sesamum was then as it is now.

 While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single sesamum,

 §

 There are, Sāriputta,
 some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through food.'

 These speak thus:

 We subsist on rice-grains,'

 and they eat rice-grains
 and they eat crushed [108] rice-grains
 and they drink rice-grain water,
 and they make use of rice-grains
 in a variety of ways.

 Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted
 on one single rice-grain.

 But I, Sāriputta,
 even by this procedure,
 by this course,
 by this mortification,
 did not reach states of further-men
 or the excellent knowledge and insight
 befitting the ariyans.

 What was the cause of this?

 It was that by these
 there is no reaching the ariyan intuitive wisdom
 which, when reached,
 is ariyan,
 leading onwards,
 and which leads onwards the doer of it
 to the complete destruction of anguish.

 §

 Now, Sāriputta,
 there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through faring on.'[86]

 But, Sāriputta, it is not easy to find that faring-on
 that I have not formerly fared-on in
 during this long past
 except among the devas of the Pure Abodes.

 For if I, Sāriputta,
 were to have fared on
 among the devas of the Pure Abodes,
 I could not have come back again to this world.

 §

 Now, Sāriputta,
 there are some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through uprising.

 But, Sāriputta,
 it is not easy to find that uprising
 that has not formerly been uprisen in by me
 during this long past,
 except among the devas of the Pure Abodes.

 For if I, Sāriputta,
 were to have uprisen
 among the devas of the Pure Abodes,
 I could not have come back again to this world.

 §

 Now, Sāriputta,
 there are some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through abode.'

 But, Sāriputta,
 it is not easy to find that abode
 that I have not abided in
 during this long past,
 except among the devas of the Pure Abodes.[87]

 For if I, Sāriputta,
 were to have abided among the devas of the Pure Abodes,
 I could not have come back again to this world.

 §

 Now, Sāriputta,
 there are some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through oblation.'

 But, [109] Sāriputta,
 it is not easy to find that oblation
 that has not formerly been offered by me
 during this long past
 when I was a noble, anointed king,
 or a wealthy brahman.

 §

 Now, Sāriputta,
 there are some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Purity is through tending the (sacrificial) fire.'

 But, Sāriputta,
 it is not easy to find that fire
 that has not formerly been tended by me
 during this long past
 when I was a noble, anointed king,
 or a wealthy brahman.

 §

 Now, Sāriputta,
 there are some recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'So long as this good man is young,
 endowed with the coal-black hair of youth,
 in his early prime,
 so long is he possessed of the utmost lucidity of wisdom.

 But when this good man is worn,
 old,
 stricken in years,
 has lived his span,
 and is at the close of his life[88]  eighty
 or ninety
 or a hundred years of age  then he falls from that lucidity of wisdom.'

 But this is not to be regarded in this way, Sāriputta.

 I, Sāriputta,
 am now worn,
 old,
 stricken in years,
 I have lived my span,
 and am at the close of my life,
 being round about eighty.[89]

 Sāriputta, I might have four disciples here,
 each of a hundred years' life-span,
 living a hundred years,
 and possessed of the utmost mindfulness,
 and attentiveness,
 and resolute energy,[90]
 and with the utmost lucidity of wisdom.

 As, Sāriputta,
 a skilled archer,
 trained,
 deft,
 a marksman,
 may with ease
 wing a slender shaft across a palm-tree's shadow,[91]
 so are these of extreme mindfulness,
 of extreme attentiveness,
 of extreme resolute energy,
 so are they possessed of the utmost lucidity of wisdom.

 If these were to ask me
 again and again
 a question about the four applications of mindfulness,[92]
 and if I,
 questioned again and again,
 were to explain to them,
 and if they,
 on being explained to by me,
 should understand as explained,
 and if they were not to question me
 about any secondary and further matter
 (nor pause), except for feeding,
 drinking,
 eating,
 tasting,
 except for answering the calls of nature,
 except for dispelling fatigue by sleep,
 still unfinished, Sāriputta,
 would be the Tathāgata's teaching of dhamma,
 still unfinished would be the Tathāgata's expositions
 on the phrases of dhamma,
 still unfinished would be the Tathāgata's ways of [110] putting questions[93]
 when these four disciples of mine,
 of life-spans of a hundred years,
 living for a hundred years,
 would pass away at the end of a hundred years.

 Yet, if you should have to carry me about on a litter, Sāriputta,
 verily there is no change in the Tathāgata's lucidity of wisdom.

 Whoever, Sāriputta, speaking rightly, should say:

 'A being not liable to delusion
 has arisen in the world
 for the welfare of the manyfolk,
 for the happiness of the manyfolk,
 out of compassion for the world,
 for the good,
 the welfare,
 the happiness of devas and men,'
 so, when he is speaking rightly of me,
 he would say:

 'A being not liable to delusion
 has arisen in the world
 for the welfare of the manyfolk,
 for the happiness of the manyfolk,
 out of compassion for the world,
 for the good,
 the welfare,
 the happiness of devas and men.'"

 Now at that time the venerable Nāgasamāla[94] spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is wonderful, Lord,
 it is marvellous, Lord,
 that when, Lord,
 this disquisition on dhamma had been heard by me,
 my hair stood on end.

 What is the name, Lord,
 of this disquisition on dhamma?"

 "Wherefore do you, Nāgasamāla, remember this disquisition on dhamma as
 the Hair-raising Disquisition."[95]

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted the venerable Nāgasamāla rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
