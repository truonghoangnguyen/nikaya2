# 110. Lesser Discourse (at the Time) of a Full Moon

## Cūḷa Puṇṇama Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the palace of Migāra's mother in the Eastern Monastery.

 Now at that time the Lord was sitting down in the open air
 on the night of a full moon
 on an Observance day,
 the fifteenth,
 surrounded by an Order of monks.

 Then the Lord, having looked round the Order of monks
 which, as he did so, became quite silent,
 addressed the monks, saying:
 "Now, monks, could a bad man[1]
 know of a bad man:

 'This worthy is a bad man'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "It is good, monks.

 This is impossible, monks,
 it cannot come to pass
 that a bad man
 could know of a bad man:

 'This worthy is a bad [71] man.'

 But, monks, could a bad man
 know of a good man:

 'This worthy is a good man'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "It is good, monks.

 This too is impossible, monks,
 it cannot come to pass
 that a bad man could know of a good man:

 'This worthy is a good man.'

 A bad man, monks,
 is possessed of bad states of mind,
 he consorts with bad men,
 he thinks as do bad men,
 he advises as do bad men,
 he speaks as do bad men,
 he acts as do bad men,
 he has the views of bad men,
 he gives a gift as do bad men.

 And how, monks, is a bad man
 possessed of bad states of mind?

 As to this, monks,
 a bad man is lacking in faith,
 he has no shame,
 no fear of blame,
 he has heard little,
 he is lazy,
 he is of muddled mindfulness,
 he is weak in wisdom  it is thus, monks, that a bad man
 is possessed of bad states of mind.

 And how, monks, does a bad man
 consort with bad men?

 As to this, monks,
 those recluses and brahmans who are lacking in faith,
 have no shame,
 no fear of blame,
 who have heard little,
 who are lazy,
 of muddled mindfulness,
 weak in wisdom  these are the friends and companions of that bad man.

 It is thus, monks, that a bad man
 consorts with bad men.

 And how, monks, does a bad man
 think as do bad men?
 As to this, monks,
 a bad man is set on self-torment,
 he is set on the torment of others,
 he is set on the torment of both  it is thus, monks, that a bad man
 thinks as do bad men.

 And how, monks,
 does a bad man
 advise as do bad men?

 As to this, monks,
 a bad man advises the torment of self
 and he advises the torment of others
 and he advises the torment of both  it is thus, monks, that a bad man
 advises as do bad men.

 And how, monks,
 does a bad man
 speak as do bad men?

 As to this, monks, a bad man
 is of lying speech,
 slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 a gossip  it is thus, monks, that a bad man
 speaks as do bad men.

 And how, monks, does a bad man
 act as do bad men?

 As to this, monks, a bad man
 is one to make onslaught on creatures,
 to take what has not been given,
 to enjoy himself wrongly among the sense-pleasures it is thus, monks that a bad man
 acts as do bad men.

 And how, monks, does a bad man
 have the views of bad men?

 As to this, monks, a bad man
 is of these views:

 'There is no (result of) gift,

 there is no fruit or ripening of deeds
 well done or ill done;
 there is not this world,
 there is not a world beyond;
 there is no (benefit from [72] serving) mother,
 no (benefit from serving) father;
 there are no spontaneously arising beings;
 there are not in the world
 recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly,
 proceeding rightly,
 and who proclaim this world
 and the world beyond,

 'This worthy is a good man'?"
