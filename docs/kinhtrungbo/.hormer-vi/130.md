# 130. Discourse on the Deva-Messengers[1]

## Devadūta Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, it is as if there were two houses with doors[2]
 and a man with vision
 standing there between them
 might see people entering a house
 and leaving it
 and going back and forth
 and walking across.

 Even so do I, monks,
 with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 see beings as they are passing hence,
 as they are coming to be,
 and see[3] that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of deeds,
 (and I think):

 'Indeed these worthy beings,
 who are endowed with right conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who are not scoffers at the ariyans,
 are of right view,
 incurring kamma consequent on right view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 are arising in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Or these worthy beings,
 who are endowed with right conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who are not scoffers at the ariyans,
 are of right view,
 incurring kamma consequent on right view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 are arising among men.

 Indeed these worthy beings,
 who arc endowed with [224] wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who are scoffers at the ariyans,
 are of false view,
 incurring kamma consequent on wrong view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 are arising in the realm of the departed.

 Or these worthy beings,
 who are endowed with wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who are scoffers at the ariyans,
 are of false view,
 incurring kamma consequent on wrong view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 are arising in an animal womb.

 Or these worthy beings, endowed with wrong in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who are scoffers at the ariyans,
 are of false view,
 incurring kamma consequent on wrong view,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 are arising in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.'
 Monks,[4] the guardians of Niraya Hell,
 having seized that person by both arms,
 present him to King Yama,
 saying:

 'This man, sire,
 has no respect for his mother,
 no respect for his father,[5]
 he does not honour recluses,
 he does not honour brahmans,
 he does not pay due respect
 to the elders of the family.

 Let your majesty decree a punishment for him.'

 Then, monks, King Yama cross-questions him,
 questions him closely
 and speaks to him
 concerning the first deva-messenger,
 saying:

 'My good man,
 did you not see the first deva-messenger
 who appeared among men?

 He speaks thus:

 'I did not see him, revered sir.'

 So, monks, King Yama speaks to him thus:

 'My good man,
 did you not see among men
 a young baby boy
 lying on his back,
 fallen prostrate among his own excrements?
 He speaks thus:

 'I saw him, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks thus to him:

 'My good man,
 although you are sensible
 and grown up,
 did it not occur to you:

 'I too am liable to birth,
 I have not outstripped birth;
 come, I (shall) do what is lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought'?

 He speaks thus:

 'I was not able to, revered sir,
 I was indolent,[6] revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'If it was because of indolence,
 my good man,
 that you did not do what was lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they will undoubtedly do unto you,
 my good man,
 in accordance with that indolence.

 For this that is an evil deed is yours;
 it was not done by mother,
 it was not done by father,
 it was not done by brother,
 it was not done by sister,
 it was not done by friends and acquaintances,
 it was not done by kith and kin,
 it was not done by recluses and brahmans,
 it was not done by dvatās.

 This evil deed was done by you;
 it is you yourself
 that will experience its ripening.'

 ■

 [225] King Yama, monks,
 having cross-questioned him,
 questioned him closely
 and spoken to him concerning the first dewa-messenger,
 then cross-questions him,
 questions him closely
 and speaks to him concerning the second deva-messenger,
 saying:

 'My good man,
 did you not see the second deva-messenger
 who appeared among men?

 He speaks thus:

 'I did not see him, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks thus to him:

 'My good man, did you not see among men
 a woman or a man
 eighty
 or ninety
 or a hundred years old,
 aged,
 crooked as a rafter,
 bent,
 leaning on a stick,
 going along palsied,
 miserable,
 youth gone,
 teeth broken,
 hair thinned,
 skin wrinkled,
 stumbling along,
 the limbs discoloured?

 He speaks thus:

 'I saw this, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks thus:

 'My good man,
 although you are sensible
 and grown up,
 did it not occur to you:

 'I too am liable to old age,
 I have not outstripped old age;
 come, I (shall) do what is lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought'?

 He speaks thus:

 'I was not able to, revered sir,
 I was indolent, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:
 'If it was because of indolence,
 my good man,
 that you did not do what was lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they will undoubtedly do unto you,
 my good man,
 in accordance with that indolence.

 For this that is an evil deed is yours;
 it was not done by mother,
 it was not done by father,
 it was not done by brother,
 it was not done by sister,
 it was not done by friends and acquaintances,
 it was not done by kith and kin,
 it was not done by recluses and brahmans,
 it was not done by dvatās.

 This evil deed was done by you;
 it is you yourself
 that will experience its ripening.'

 ■

 King Yama, monks,
 having cross-questioned him,
 questioned him closely
 and spoken to him concerning the second dewa-messenger,
 then cross-questions him,
 questions him closely
 and speaks to him concerning the third deva-messenger,
 saying:

 'My good man,
 did you not see the third deva-messenger
 who appeared among men?

 He speaks thus:

 'I did not see him, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'My good man, did you not see among men
 a woman or a man
 afflicted with illness,
 suffering,
 grievously ill,
 fallen prostrate among his own excrements,
 (only) rising with (the help of) others,
 (only) getting to bed with (the help of) others?

 He speaks thus:

 'I saw this, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks thus:

 'My good man,
 although you are sensible
 and grown up,
 did it not occur to you:

 'I too am liable to sickness,
 I have not outstripped sickness;
 come, I (shall) do what is lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought'?

 He speaks thus:
 'I was not able to, revered sir,
 I was indolent, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'If it was because of indolence,
 my good man,
 that you did not do what was lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they will undoubtedly do unto you,
 my good man,
 in accordance with that indolence.

 For this that is an evil deed is yours;
 it was not done by mother,
 it was not done by father,
 it was not done by brother,
 it was not done by sister,
 it was not done by friends and acquaintances,
 it was not done by kith and kin,
 it was not done by recluses and brahmans,
 it was not done by dvatās.

 This evil deed was done by you;
 it is you yourself
 that will experience its ripening.'

 ■

 King Yama, monks,
 having cross-questioned him,
 questioned him [226] closely
 and spoken to him concerning the third dewa-messenger,
 then cross-questions him,
 questions him closely
 and speaks to him concerning the fourth deva-messenger,
 saying:

 'My good man,
 did you not see the fourth deva-messenger
 who appeared among men?

 He speaks thus:

 'I did not see him, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'My good man,
 did you not see among men
 kings who, having arrested a thief,
 an evil-doer,
 were subjecting him to various punishments:
 they lash him with whips,
 and they lash him with canes,
 and they lash him with (birch) rods,
 and they cut off his hand,
 and they cut off his foot,
 and they cut off his hand and foot,
 and they cut off his his ear,
 and they cut off his his nose,
 and they cut off his his ear and nose,
 and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,
 and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,
 and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,
 and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,
 and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,
 and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,
 and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,
 and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,
 and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,
 and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,
 and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'
 and they spray him with burning oil,
 give him as food to the dogs,
 impale him alive on stakes,
 and they decapitate him with a sword?

 He speaks thus:

 'I saw this, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'My good man,
 although you are sensible
 and grown up,
 did it not occur to you:

 'Indeed those who do evil deeds
 are subjected to various punishments like these
 here and now,
 and what about hereafter?

 Come, I (shall) do what is lovely in body, speech and thought'?

 He speaks thus:

 'I was not able to, revered sir,
 I was indolent, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'If it was because of indolence, my good man,
 that you did not do what was lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they will undoubtedly do unto you,
 my good man,
 in accordance with that indolence.

 For this that is an evil deed is yours;
 it was not done by mother,
 it was not done by father,
 it was not done by brother,
 it was not done by sister,
 it was not done by friends and acquaintances,
 it was not done by kith and kin,
 it was not done by recluses and brahmans,
 it was not done by dvatās.

 This evil deed was done by you;
 it is you yourself
 that will experience its ripening.'

 King Yama, monks,
 having cross-questioned him,
 questioned him closely
 and spoken to him concerning the fourth deva-messenger,
 then cross-questions him,
 questions him closely
 and speaks to him concerning the fifth deva-messenger,
 saying:

 'My good man,
 did you not see the fifth deva-messenger
 who appeared among men?'

 He speaks thus:

 'I did not see him, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:
 'My good man,
 did you not see among men
 a woman or a man
 dead for one,
 two
 or three days,
 swollen,
 discoloured,
 decomposing?

 He speaks thus:

 'I saw this, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'My good man, although you are sensible
 and grown up,
 did it not occur to you:

 'I too am liable to death,
 I have not outstripped death;
 come, I (shall) do what is lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought'?:

 'I was not able to, revered sir,
 I was indolent, revered sir.'

 King Yama, monks, speaks to him thus:

 'If it was because of indolence, my good man,
 that you did not do what was lovely in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they will undoubtedly do unto you,
 my good man,
 in accordance with that indolence.

 For this that is an evil deed is yours;
 it was not done by mother,
 it was not done by father,
 it was not done by brother,
 it was not done by sister,
 it was not done by friends and acquaintances,
 it was not done by kith and kin,
 it was not done by [227] recluses and brahmans,
 it was not done by dvatās.

 This evil deed was done by you;
 it is you yourself
 that will experience its ripening.'

 King Yama, monks,
 having cross-questioned him,
 questioned him closely
 and spoken to him concerning the fifth deva-messenger,
 was silent.

 Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 subject him to what is called the fivefold pinion.[7]

 They drive a red-hot iron stake
 through each hand
 and each foot
 and a red-hot iron stake
 through the middle of his breast.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.
 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then the guardians of Niraya Hell
 lay him down
 and plane him with adzes.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 place him feet up
 and head down
 and plane him with razors.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 bind him to a chariot
 and drive him up and down
 over ground that is burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.
 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 push him up and down
 a great mountain slope
 of glowing cinders,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 take him,
 feet up and head down,
 and plunge him into a glowing brazen cauldron,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 There he is boiled
 and rises to the surface with the scum.

 Boiling there
 and rising to the surface with the scum,
 he comes up once
 and goes down once
 and once he goes across.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 toss him into the Great Niraya Hell.

 Now, monks, this Great Niraya Hell
 (is so described):

 Four-cornered and with four gates,
 It is divided into equal portions,
 Encircled by an iron wall, with a roof of iron above;
 Its incandescent floor is made of glowing iron;
 All round it stands a hundred yojanas square.

 The flames that leap up by the eastern wall of this Great Niraya Hell, monks,
 are hurled against the western wall;
 the flames that leap up by the western wall
 are hurled against the eastern wall;
 the flames that leap up by the northern wall
 are hurled against the southern wall;
 the flames that leap up by the southern wall
 are hurled against the northern wall;
 the flames that leap up from below
 are hurled above;
 the flames that leap up from above
 are hurled below.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.[8]
 Monks, there comes a time
 once in a very long while
 when the eastern gateway of this Great Niraya Hell is opened.

 He rushes there swiftly and speedily;
 while he is rushing swiftly and speedily
 his skin burns
 and his hide burns
 and his flesh burns
 and his tendons burn
 and his eyes[9] are filled with smoke  such is his plight.[10]

 And though he has attained much,[11]
 the gateway is nevertheless closed [228] against him.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 He rushes there swiftly and speedily;
 while he is rushing swiftly and speedily
 his skin burns
 and his hide burns
 and his flesh burns
 and his tendons burn
 and his eyes are filled with smoke  such is his plight.
 He issues forth by this gateway.

 But, monks, adjacent to this Great Niraya Hell
 is the Great Filth Hell.[12]

 He falls into it.

 And, monks, in that Filth Hell
 needle-mouthed creatures cut away his skin;
 having cut away his skin
 they cut away his hide;
 having cut away his hide
 they cut away his flesh;
 having cut away his flesh
 they cut away his tendons;
 having cut away his tendons
 they cut away his bones;
 having cut away his bones
 they devour the marrow of the bones.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 And, monks, adjacent to this Filth Hell
 is the great Ember Hell.[13]

 He falls into it.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.
 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 And, monks, adjacent to that Ember Hell
 is the great Forest of Silk-Cotton Trees[14]
 towering a yojana high
 with prickles a finger-breadth long,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 They make him climb up
 and they make him climb down.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 And, monks, adjacent to that Forest of Silk-Cotton Trees
 is the great Sword-leafed Forest.[15]

 He enters it.

 Its leaves,
 stirred by the wind,
 cut off his hands
 and cut off his feet
 and cut off his hands and feet and cut off his his ear,
 and cut off his his nose,
 and cut off his his ears and nose.

 Thereat [229] he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.
 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 And, monks, adjacent to that Sword-leafed Forest
 is the great River of Caustic Water.[16]

 He falls into it.

 There he is carried with the steam
 and he is carried against the stream
 and he is carried with and against the stream.[17]

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell haul him out[18] with a fish-hook,
 set him on dry ground
 and speak thus to him:

 'My good man,
 what do you want?'

 He speaks thus:

 'I am hungry, revered sirs.'

 Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell,
 opening his mouth with a glowing iron spike,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze,
 then push into his mouth
 a glowing copper pellet,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 It burns his lips
 and it burns his mouth
 and it burns his throat
 and it burns his chest
 and it passes out below
 taking with it his bowels and intestines.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 speak thus to him:

 'My good man, what do you want?

 He speaks thus:

 'I am thirsty, revered sirs.'

 Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell,
 opening his mouth with a glowing iron spike,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze,
 sprinkle glowing copper and bronze into his mouth,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.
 It burns his lips
 and it burns his mouth
 and it burns his throat
 and it burns his chest
 and it passes out below
 taking with it his bowels and intestines.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 push him back again
 into the Great Niraya Hell.

 Once upon a time, monks,
 it occurred to King Yama:

 'Those that do evil deeds in the world
 are subjected to a variety of punishments like these.
