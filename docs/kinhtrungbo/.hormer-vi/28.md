 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:
 "Reverend monks."

 "Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:

 "As, your reverences,
 among all creatures that can walk[1]
 all pedal qualities are combined in an elephant's foot,[2]
 and as the elephant's foot is chief among these
 in point of size,
 so, your reverences,
 all skilled states of mind
 are included among the four ariyan truths.

 Among what four?

 Among the ariyan truth of anguish,
 among the ariyan truth of the uprising of anguish,
 among the ariyan truth of the stopping of anguish,
 among the ariyan truth of the course
 leading to the stopping of anguish.

 [231] And what, your reverences,
 is the ariyan truth of anguish?[3]

 Birth is anguish
 and ageing is anguish
 and dying is anguish;
 and grief,
 lamentation,
 sorrow,
 tribulation
 and despair are anguish,
 and not getting what one wants,
 that too is anguish.

 In brief
 the five groups of grasping are anguish.

 And what, your reverences,
 are the five groups of grasping?

 Just these;
 the group of grasping after material shape,
 the group of grasping after feeling,
 the group of grasping after perception,
 the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,
 the group of grasping after consciousness.[4]

 And what, your reverences,
 is the group of grasping after material shapes?

 The four great elements,
 and the material shape that is derived
 from the four great elements.
 And what, your reverences,
 are the four great elements?

 The element of extension,
 the liquid element,
 the element of heat,
 the element of motion.[5]

 And what, your reverences,
 is the element of extension?

 The element of extension may be internal,
 it may be external.

 And what,[6] your reverences,
 is the internal element of extension?

 Whatever is[7] hard,
 solid,
 is internal,[8]
 referable to an individual[88]
 and derived therefrom,
 that is to say:

 the hair of the head,
 the hair of the body,
 nails,
 teeth,
 skin,
 flesh,
 sinews,
 bones,
 marrow of the bones,
 kidney,
 heart,
 liver,
 pleura,
 spleen,
 lungs,
 intestines,
 mesentery,
 stomach,
 excrement,
 or whatever other thing is hard,
 solid,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 or derived therefrom
 this, your reverences,
 is called the internal element of extension.

 Whatever[9] is an internal element of extension
 and whatever is an external element of extension,[10]
 just these are the element of extension.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 it should be seen of this
 as it really is, thus:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of extension,
 he cleanses his mind
 of the element of extension.

 [232] There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the element of extension[11]
 that is external
 is agitated;
 at that time the external element of extension disappears.

 The impermanence
 of this ancient external element of extension
 can be shown, your reverences,
 its liability to destruction can be shown,
 its liability to decay can be shown,
 its liability to change can be shown.

 So what of this short-lived body
 derived from craving?

 There is not anything here for saying,
 'I'
 or 'mine'
 or 'I am.'

 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,[12]
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:

 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'

 He sees that sensory impingement[13] is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on[14] the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:

 'This body is such
 that blows from hands affect it
 and blows from clods of earth affect it
 and blows from sticks affect it
 and blows from weapons affect it.
 But this was said by the Lord
 in the Parable of the Saw:[15]

 "If, monks,
 low-down thieves should carve you limb from limb
 with a two-handled saw,
 whoever sets his heart at enmity,
 he, for this reason,
 is not a doer of my teaching."

 Unsluggish energy shall come to be stirred up by me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 the body tranquillised,
 impassible,
 the mind composed and one-pointed.

 Now, willingly,
 let blows from hands affect this body,
 let blows from clods of earth this body,
 let blows from sticks this body,
 let blows from weapons affect it,
 for this teaching of the Awakened Ones is being done.'

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,[16]
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on [233] skill;[17]
 he is strongly moved[18] because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.

 And what, your reverences, is the liquid element?

 The liquid element[19] may be internal,
 it may be external.

 And what, your reverences,
 is the internal liquid element?

 Whatever is liquid,
 fluid,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 or derived therefrom,
 that is to say:

 bile,
 phlegm,
 pus,
 blood,
 sweat,
 fat,
 tears,
 serum,
 saliva,
 mucus,
 synovial fluid,
 urine
 or whatever other thing is liquid,
 fluid,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 or derived therefrom  this, your reverences,
 is called the internal liquid element.

 Whatever is an internal liquid element
 and whatever is an external liquid element,
 just these are the liquid element.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 it should be seen of this
 as it really is, thus:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the liquid element,
 he cleanses his mind
 of the liquid element.

 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the liquid element that is external is agitated;
 it carries away villages
 and it carries away little towns
 and it carries away towns
 and it carries away districts
 and it carries away districts and regions.
 There [234] comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the waters in the great ocean[20] go down[21] a hundred yojanas,
 and when they go down two hundred yojanas,
 and when they go down three hundred yojanas,
 and when they go down four hundred yojanas,
 and when they go down five hundred yojanas,
 and when they go down six hundred yojanas
 and when they go down seven hundred yojanas.

 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the water in the great ocean
 stands at (the height of) seven palm trees (in depth),
 when the water stands at (the height of) six palm trees (in depth),
 when the water stands at (the height of) five palm trees (in depth),
 when the water stands at (the height of) four palm trees (in depth),
 when the water stands at (the height of) three palm trees (in depth),
 when the water stands at (the height of) two palm trees (in depth)
 and when the water stands at (the height of) one palm tree (in depth).

 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) seven men's stature,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) six men's stature,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) five men's stature,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) four men's stature,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) three men's stature,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) two men's stature and when the water stands at (the depth of) merely one man's stature.

 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the water in the great ocean stands at (the depth of) half a man's stature,
 and when the water stands merely up to his hip,
 and when the water stands merely up to his knee,
 and when the water stands merely up to his ankle.
 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when the water in the great ocean
 does not wet even a toe-joint.

 The impermanence of this ancient liquid element
 that is external
 can be shown, your reverences,

 its liability to destruction can be shown,
 its liability to decay can be shown,
 its liability to change can be shown.

 So what of this short-lived body
 derived from craving?

 There is not anything here for saying,
 'I'
 or 'mine'
 or 'I am.'

 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:

 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'
 He sees that sensory impingement is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:

 'This body is such
 that blows from hands affect it
 and blows from clods of earth affect it
 and blows from sticks affect it
 and blows from weapons affect it.

 But this was said by the Lord
 in the Parable of the Saw:

 "If, monks,
 low-down thieves should carve you limb from limb
 with a two-handled saw,
 whoever sets his heart at enmity,
 he, for this reason,
 is not a doer of my teaching."

 Now, willingly,
 let blows from hands affect this body,
 let blows from clods of earth this body,
 let blows from sticks this body,
 let blows from weapons affect it,
 for this teaching of the Awakened Ones is being done.'

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on skill;
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'
 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.
 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:

 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'

 He sees that sensory impingement is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:
 'This body is such
 that blows from hands affect it
 and blows from clods of earth affect it
 and blows from sticks affect it
 and blows from weapons affect it.

 But this was said by the Lord
 in the Parable of the Saw:

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on skill;
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'
 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.

 And what, your reverences, is the element of heat?[22]

 The heat element may be internal,
 it may be external.

 And what, your reverences,
 is the internal heat element?

 Whatever is heat,
 warmth,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 such as by whatever one is vitalised,
 by whatever one is consumed,
 by whatever one is burnt up,
 and by whatever one has munched,
 drunk,
 eaten
 and tasted
 that is properly transmuted (in digestion),
 or whatever other thing is heat,
 warmth,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 or derived therefrom-this, your reverences,
 is called the internal heat element.

 Whatever is an internal element of heat
 and whatever is an external element of heat,
 just these are the element of heat.

 By means of perfect intuitive [235] wisdom
 it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not myself.

 Having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the heat element,
 he cleanses his mind of the heat element.

 There comes a time, your reverences,
 when the element of heat that is external is agitated,
 and it burns up villages
 and it burns up little towns
 and it burns up towns
 and it burns up districts
 and it burns up districts and regions.

 When it has come to the end of the crops
 or to the end of a highway
 or to the end of a mountain
 or to the end of water
 or to a lovely stretch of level ground,
 it is extinguished[23] through lack of fuel.

 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when people seek to light a fire
 with a cock's feather
 or with snippets of gristle.[24]

 The impermanence of this ancient external element of heat can be shown, your reverences,
 its liability to destruction can be shown,
 its liability to decay can be shown,
 its liability to change can be shown.

 So what of this short-lived body
 derived from craving?

 There is not anything here for saying,
 'I'
 or 'mine'
 or 'I am.'

 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:

 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'
 He sees that sensory impingement is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:

 'This body is such
 that blows from hands affect it
 and blows from clods of earth affect it
 and blows from sticks affect it
 and blows from weapons affect it.

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on skill;
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'
 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.
 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:

 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'

 He sees that sensory impingement is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:
 'This body is such

 and blows from clods of earth affect it

 and blows from weapons affect it.

 But this was said by the Lord

 let blows from clods of earth this body,
 let blows from sticks this body,

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on skill;
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'
 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.

 And what, your reverences, is the element of motion?[25]

 The element of motion may be internal,
 it may be external.

 And what, your reverences,
 is the internal element of motion?

 Whatever is motion,
 wind,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 such as winds going upwards,
 winds going downwards,
 winds in the abdomen,
 winds in the belly,
 winds that shoot across the several limbs,
 in-breathing,
 out-breathing,
 or whatever other thing is motion,
 wind,
 is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom  this, your reverences,
 is called the internal element of motion.

 Whatever is an internal element of motion
 and whatever is an external element of motion,
 just these are the element of motion.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 it should be seen of this
 as it really is, thus:

 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not myself.

 Having seen this thus as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of motion,
 he cleanses his mind of the element of motion.

 There comes a time, your reverences,
 when the element of motion that is external is agitated,
 and it carries away villages
 and it carries away little towns
 and it carries away towns
 and it carries away districts
 and it carries away districts and regions.

 There comes to be a time, your reverences,
 when in the last month of the hot weather
 people are looking about for wind
 by means [236] of a palm (leaf) fan[26]
 and a fan for fanning the fire,[26]
 and they do not expect grasses in the top of the thatch.[27]

 The impermanence of this ancient external element of motion can be shown, your reverences,
 its liability to destruction can be shown,
 its liability to decay can be shown,
 its liability to change can be shown.

 So what of this short-lived body
 derived from craving?

 There is not anything here for saying,
 'I'
 or 'mine'
 or 'I am.'

 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:

 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'

 He sees that sensory impingement is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:

 'This body is such
 that blows from hands affect it
 and blows from clods of earth affect it
 and blows from sticks affect it
 and blows from weapons affect it.

 But this was said by the Lord
 in the Parable of the Saw:

 "If, monks,
 low-down thieves should carve you limb from limb
 with a two-handled saw,
 whoever sets his heart at enmity,
 he, for this reason,
 is not a doer of my teaching."

 Unsluggish energy shall come to be stirred up by me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 the body tranquillised,
 impassible,
 the mind composed and one-pointed.

 Now, willingly,
 let blows from hands affect this body,
 let blows from clods of earth this body,
 let blows from sticks this body,
 let blows from weapons affect it,
 for this teaching of the Awakened Ones is being done.'

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on skill;
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.

 Your reverences,
 if others abuse,
 revile,
 annoy,
 vex this monk,
 he comprehends:
 'This painful feeling that has arisen in me
 is born of sensory impingement on the ear,
 it has a cause,
 not no cause.

 What is the cause?

 Sensory impingement is the cause.'

 He sees that sensory impingement is impermanent,
 he sees that feeling is impermanent,
 he sees that perception is impermanent,
 he sees that the habitual tendencies are impermanent,
 he sees that consciousness is impermanent.

 His mind rejoices,
 is pleased,
 composed
 and is set on the objects of the element.

 If, your reverences,
 others comport themselves in undesirable,
 disagreeable,
 unpleasant ways
 towards that monk,
 and he receives blows from their hands
 and from clods of earth
 and from sticks
 and weapons,
 he comprehends thus:

 'This body is such
 that blows from hands affect it
 and blows from clods of earth affect it
 and blows from sticks affect it
 and blows from weapons affect it.
 But this was said by the Lord
 in the Parable of the Saw:

 "If, monks,
 low-down thieves should carve you limb from limb

 Now, willingly,
 let blows from hands affect this body,
 let blows from clods of earth this body,
 let blows from sticks this body,
 let blows from weapons affect it,
 for this teaching of the Awakened Ones is being done.'

 If, your reverences,
 this monk recollects the Awakened One thus,
 if he recollects dhamma thus,
 if he recollects the Order thus,
 but there is not established (in him)
 the equanimity that depends on skill;
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition, and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 Your reverences, as a daughter-in-law,
 having seen her father-in-law,
 is strongly moved
 and comes to a strongly moved condition,
 so, your reverences,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One,
 if while this monk is recollecting the dhamma,
 if while this monk is recollecting the Order,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in him);
 he is strongly moved because of this,
 he comes to a strongly moved condition,
 and thinks:

 'It is unprofitable for me,
 it is not profitable for me,
 it is ill gotten by me,
 it is not well gotten by me
 that, although I recollect the Awakened One thus,
 although I recollect dhamma thus,
 although I recollect the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is not established (in me).'

 But if, your reverences,
 while this monk is recollecting the Awakened One thus
 while this monk is recollecting the dhamma thus
 while this monk is recollecting the Order thus,
 the equanimity that depends on skill
 is established (in him),
 he, because of this is pleased.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.

 Your reverences, just as a space that is enclosed
 by stakes
 and creepers
 and grass
 and clay
 is known as a dwelling,
 so a space that is enclosed
 by bones
 and sinews
 and flesh
 and skin
 is known as a material shape.

 If, your reverences,
 the eye that is internal is intact[28]
 but external material shapes
 do not come within its range
 and there is no appropriate impact,
 then there is no appearance
 of the appropriate section[29] of consciousness.
 If, your reverences,
 the eye that is internal is intact
 and external material shapes
 come within its range
 but without an appropriate impact,
 then there is no appearance
 of the appropriate section of consciousness.

 But when, your reverences,
 the eye that is internal is intact
 and external material shapes
 come within its range
 and there is the appropriate impact,
 then there is thus an appearance
 of the appropriate section of consciousness.

 Whatever is material shape
 in what has thus come to be,
 it is included in the group
 of grasping after material shape.

 Whatever is feeling
 in what has thus come to be,
 it is included in the group of grasping after feeling.

 Whatever is perception
 in what has thus come to be,
 it is included in the group of grasping after perception.

 Whatever are the habitual tendencies
 in what has thus come to be,
 they are included in the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies.

 Whatever is consciousness
 in what has thus come to be,
 it is included in the group of grasping after consciousness.
 He comprehends thus:

 'Thus there is,
 so it is said,
 the including,
 the collecting together,
 the coming together
 of these five groups of grasping,'

 This was said by the Lord:

 'Whoever sees conditioned genesis sees [237] dhamma,
 whoever sees dhamma sees conditioned genesis.'[30]

 These are generated by conditions:
 that is to say the five groups of grasping.

 Whatever among these five groups of grasping
 is desire,
 sensual pleasure,
 affection,
 catching at,
 that is the uprising of anguish.

 Whatever among these five groups of grasping
 is the control of desire and attachment,[31]
 the ejection of desire and attachment,[31]
 that is the stopping of anguish.

 Up to this point, your reverences,
 much has been done by the monk.
 If, your reverences,
 the ear that is internal is intact
 but external sounds
 do not come within its range
 and there is no appropriate impact,
 then there is no appearance

 If, your reverences,
 the nose that is internal is intact
 but external scents
 do not come within its range
 and there is no appropriate impact,
 then there is no appearance
 of the appropriate section of consciousness.

 If, your reverences,
 the nose that is internal is intact
 and external scents
 come within its range
 but without an appropriate impact,
