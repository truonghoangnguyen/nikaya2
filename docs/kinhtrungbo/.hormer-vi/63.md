# 63. Lesser Discourse to Māluṅkya (Putta)

## Cūḷa Māluṅkya Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then a reasoning of mind
 arose to the venerable Māluṅkyāputta[2]
 as he was meditating in solitary seclusion,
 thus:

 "Those (speculative) views that are not explained,
 set aside
 and ignored by the Lord:

 The world is eternal,
 the world is not eternal,
 the world is an ending thing,
 the world is not an ending thing;
 the life-principle is the same as the body,
 the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 the Tathāgata[3] is after dying,
 the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying  the Lord does not explain these to me.

 That the Lord does not explain these to me
 does not please me,
 does not satisfy me,
 so I, having approached the Lord,
 will question him on the matter.

 If [98] the Lord will explain to me
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 then will I fare the Brahma-faring under the Lord.

 But if the Lord will not explain to me
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 then will I, disavowing the training,
 revert to secular life."

 Then the venerable Māluṅkyāputta,
 emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Māluṅkyāputta spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Now, revered sir, as I was meditating in solitary seclusion,
 a reasoning of mind arose to me thus:

 'Those (speculative) views that are not explained,
 set aside,
 ignored by the Lord:

 The world is eternal,
 the world is not eternal,
 the world is an ending thing,
 the world is not an ending thing;
 the life-principle is the same as the body,
 the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 the Tathāgata is after dying,
 the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying  the Lord does not explain these to me.

 That the Lord does not explain these to me
 does not please me,
 does not satisfy me,
 so I, having approached the Lord,
 will question him on the matter.

 If the Lord will explain to me
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 then will I fare the Brahma-faring under the Lord.

 But if the Lord will not explain to me
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 then will I, disavowing the training,
 revert to secular life."

 If the Lord knows that the world is eternal,
 let the Lord explain to me
 that the world is eternal.

 If the Lord knows that the world is not eternal,
 let the Lord explain to me that the world is not eternal.

 If the Lord does not know whether the world is eternal
 or whether the world is not eternal,
 then, not knowing,
 not seeing,
 this would be honest,
 namely to say:

 'I do not know,
 I do not see.'

 ■

 If the Lord knows that the world is an ending thing,
 let the Lord explain to me
 that the world is an ending thing.

 If the Lord knows that the world is not an ending thing,
 let the Lord explain to me that the world is not an ending thing.

 If the Lord does not know whether the world is an ending thing
 or whether the world is not an ending thing,
 then, not knowing,
 not seeing,
 this would be honest,
 namely to say:

 'I do not know,
 I do not see.'

 ■

 If the Lord knows that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 let the Lord explain to me
 that the life-principle is the same as the body.

 If the Lord knows that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another,
 let the Lord explain to me that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another.

 If the Lord does not know whether the life-principle is the same as the body
 or whether the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another,
 then, not knowing,
 not seeing,
 this would be honest,
 namely to say:

 'I do not know,
 I do not see.'

 ■

 If the Lord knows that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 let the Lord explain to me
 that the Tathāgata is after dying.

 If the Lord knows that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 let the Lord explain to me that the Tathāgata is not after dying.
 If the Lord knows that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 let the Lord explain to me that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying.

 If the Lord knows that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 let the Lord explain to me that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying.

 If the Lord does not know that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 then, not knowing,
 not seeing,
 this would be honest,
 namely to say:

 'I do not know,
 I do not see.'

 "But did I ever speak thus to you, Māluṅkyāputta:

 'Come you, Māluṅkyāputta,
 fare the Brahma-faring under me
 and I will explain to you
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying?"

 "No, revered sir."
 "Or did you speak thus to me:

 'I, revered sir, will fare the Brahma-faring under the Lord
 if the Lord will explain to me
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying'?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "So it is agreed, Māluṅkyāputta, that neither did I say:

 'Come you, Māluṅkyāputta,
 fare the Brahma-faring under me
 and I will explain to you
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,

 [99] and that neither did you say:
 'I, revered sir, will fare the Brahma-faring under the Lord
 if the Lord will explain to me
 either that the world is eternal
 or that the world is not eternal
 or that the world is an ending thing,
 or that the world is not an ending thing;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying'."

 This being so, foolish man,
 who are you that you are disavowing?[4]

 Whoever, Māluṅkyāputta, should speak thus:

 'I will not fare the Brahma-faring under the Lord
 until the Lord explains to me
 whether the world is eternal
 or whether the world is not eternal
 or whether the world is an ending thing,
 or whether the world is not an ending thing;
 whether the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 or whether the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying

 - this man might pass away, Māluṅkyāputta,
 or ever this was explained to him by the Tathāgata.
 Māluṅkyāputta, it is as if a man were pierced by an arrow
 that was thickly smeared with poison
 and his friends and relations,
 his kith and kin,
 were to procure a physician
 and surgeon.[5]

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the man who pierced me
 whether he is a noble
 or brahman
 or merchant
 or worker.'

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know the name and clan
 of the man who pierced me.'

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the man who pierced me
 whether he is tall
 or short
 or middling in height.'

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the man who pierced me
 whether he is black
 or deep brown
 or golden skinned.'
 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the man who pierced me
 to what village
 or market town
 or town
 he belongs.'

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the bow from which I was pierced
 whether it was a spring-bow[6]
 or a cross-bow.'

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the bow-string from which I was pierced
 whether it was of swallow-wort
 or of reed
 or sinew
 or hemp
 or a tree.'[7] He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the shaft by which I was pierced
 whether it was of reeds
 of this kind
 or that.'[8]

 He [100] might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the shaft from which I was pierced
 what kind of feathers it had:
 whether those of a vulture
 or heron
 or hawk
 or peacock
 or some other bird.'[9]

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the shaft from which I was pierced
 with what kind of sinews it was encased:
 whether those of a cow
 or buffalo
 or deer
 or monkey.'[10]

 He might speak thus:

 'I will not draw out this arrow
 until I know of the arrow by which I was pierced
 whether it was an (ordinary) arrow
 or some other kind of arrow.'[11]

 Māluṅkyāputta, this man might pass away
 or ever this was known to him.

 In the same way, Malunkyaputta,
 whoever should speak thus:

 'I will not fare the Brahma-faring under the Lord
 until the Lord explains to me
 whether the world is eternal
 or whether the world is not eternal
 or whether the world is an ending thing,
 or whether the world is not an ending thing;
 whether the life-principle is the same as the body,
 or that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another;
 or whether the Tathāgata is after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying,
 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying

 - this man might pass away, Māluṅkyāputta,
 or ever this was explained to him by the Tathāgata.

 The living of the Brahma-faring, Māluṅkyāputta,
 could not be said to depend on the view
 that the world is eternal.

 Nor could the living of the Brahma-faring, Māluṅkyāputta,
 be said to depend on the view
 that the world is not eternal.

 Whether there is the view that the world is eternal
 or whether there is the view that the world is not eternal,
 there is birth,
 there is ageing,
 there is dying,
 there are grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair,
 the suppression[12] of which
 I lay down here and now.

 or that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying,
 there is birth,

 [101] there is ageing,

 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair,
 the suppression of which
 I lay down here and now.

 Wherefore, Māluṅkyāputta, understand
 as not explained
 what has not been explained by me,
 and understand as explained
 what has been explained by me.

 And what, Māluṅkyāputta, has not been explained by me?

 That the world is eternal has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the world is not eternal has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the world is an ending thing has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the world is not an ending thing has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the life-principle is the same as the body, has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the life-principle is one thing,
 the body another has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the Tathāgata is after dying, has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the Tathāgata is not after dying has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;
 that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta.

 And why, Māluṅkyāputta, has this not been explained by me?

 It is because it is not connected with the goal,
 is not fundamental to the Brahma-faring,
 and does not conduce to turning away from,
 nor to dispassion,
 stopping,
 calming,
 super-knowledge,
 awakening nor to nibbāna.

 Therefore it has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta.

 And what has been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta?

 'This is anguish'
 has been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta.

 'This is the arising of anguish'
 has been explained by me.

 'This is the stopping of anguish'
 has been explained by me.

 'This is the course leading to the stopping of anguish'
 has been explained by me.

 And why, Māluṅkyāputta,
 has this been explained by me?

 It is because it is connected with the goal,
 is fundamental to the Brahma-faring,
 and conduces to turning away from,
 to dispassion,
 stopping,
 calming,
 super-knowledge,
 awakening
 and nibbāna.

 Therefore it has been explained by me.
 Wherefore, Māluṅkyāputta,
 understand as not explained
 what has not been explained by me,
 and understand as explained
 what has been explained by me."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Māluṅkyāputta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
