# 129. Discourse on Fools and the Wise

## Bālapaṇḍita Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, these are the three marks of a fool,[1]
 signs of a fool,
 stamps of a fool.

 What three?
 As to this, monks, a fool is one thinking wrong thoughts,[2]
 speaking wrong words,[3]
 a doer of deeds wrongly done.[4]

 If, monks, a fool were not one thinking wrong thoughts,
 speaking wrong words,
 and a doer of deeds wrongly done,
 how could the wise know of him:

 This fine fellow is a fool,
 not a true man?

 It is because, monks, a fool is one thinking wrong thoughts,
 speaking wrong words,
 and a doer of deeds wrongly done,
 that the wise know of him:

 This fine fellow is a fool,
 not a true man.

 Monks, he who is a fool
 experiences a threefold anguish and dejection
 here and now.

 If, monks, a fool is sitting down
 in an assembly room
 or by a carriage-road
 or at a cross-roads
 and if the people there held appropriate suitable talk about him
 and if, monks, the fool were one who made onslaught on creatures,
 were a taker of what had not been given,
 one who behaved wrongly in regard to sense-pleasures,
 a liar,
 and one given up to occasions for sloth
 consequent upon (drinking) arrack,
 toddy
 and strong liquor,
 and if, monks, it then occurs to that fool:

 'These people are holding an appropriate suitable talk about me,
 for these states exist in me
 and I engage in[5] these states,'

 this, monks, is the first (kind of) anguish and dejection
 that the fool experiences
 here and now.

 ■

 And again, monks, a fool sees kings
 who, having arrested a thief,
 an evil-doer,
 are meting out various punishments:[6]
 they lash [210] him with whips,
 and they lash him with canes,
 and they lash him with (birch) rods,
 and they cut off his hand,
 and they cut off his foot,
 and they cut off his hand and foot,
 and they cut off his his ear,
 and they cut off his his nose,
 and they cut off his his ear and nose,
 and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,
 and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,
 and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,
 and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,
 and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,
 and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,
 and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,
 and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,
 and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,
 and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,
 and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'
 and they spray him with burning oil,
 give him as food to the dogs,
 impale him alive on stakes,
 and they decapitate him with a sword.

 Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the fool:

 'Because of such and such evil deeds
 kings, having arrested a thief,
 an evil-doer,
 mete out various punishments:
 they lash him with whips,
 and they lash him with canes,
 and they lash him with (birch) rods,
 and they cut off his hand,
 and they cut off his foot,
 and they cut off his hand and foot,
 and they cut off his his ear,
 and they cut off his his nose,
 and they cut off his his ear and nose,
 and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,
 and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,
 and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,
 and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,
 and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,
 and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,
 and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,
 and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,
 and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,
 and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,
 and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'
 and they spray him with burning oil,
 give him as food to the dogs,
 impale him alive on stakes,
 and they decapitate him with a sword.

 But these states exist in me
 and I engage in these states.

 So if kings should know about me,
 they might have me arrested too,
 and mete out various punishments:
 they might lash me with whips,
 they might lash me with canes,
 they might lash me with (birch) rods,
 they might cut off my hand,
 they might cut off my foot,
 they might cut off my hand and foot,
 they might cut off my my ear,
 they might cut off my my nose,
 they might cut off my his ear and nose,
 they might give me the 'gruel-pot' punishment,
 they might give me the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,
 they might give me the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,
 they might give me the 'fire-garland' punishment,
 they might give me the 'flaming hand' punishment,
 they might give me the 'hay-twist' punishment,
 they might give me the 'bark-dress' punishment,
 they might give me the 'antelope' punishment,
 they might give me the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,
 they might give me the 'disc-slice' punishment,
 they might give me the 'pickling process' punishment,
 they might give me the 'circling the pin' punishment,
 they might give me the 'straw-mattress,'
 they might spray me with burning oil,
 give me as food to the dogs,
 impale me alive on stakes,
 and they decapitate me with a sword.'

 This, monks, is the second (kind' of) anguish and dejection
 that the fool experiences
 here and now.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 while a fool is on a chair
 or bed
 or lying on the ground,
 at such a time those evil deeds
 that he has formerly wrongly done
 by body,
 speech
 and thought
 rest on him,
 lie on him,
 settle on him.[7]

 Monks, as at eventide
 the shadows of the great mountain peaks
 rest,
 lie
 and settle on the earth,
 so, monks, do these evil deeds
 that the fool has formerly wrongly done
 by body,
 speech
 and thought
 rest,
 lie
 and settle on him
 as he is on a chair
 or bed
 or lying on the ground.

 Thereupon, monks, it occurs thus to the fool:

 'Indeed what is lovely
 has not been done by me,[8]
 what is skilled
 has not been done,
 no refuge against fearful (consequences)[9]
 has been made,
 evil has been done,
 cruelty has been done,
 violence has been done.

 Insofar as there is a bourn
 for those who have not done what is lovely,
 have not done what is skilled,
 have not made a refuge against fearful (consequences),
 who have done evil, cruelty and violence,
 to that bourn I am going hereafter.'

 He grieves,
 mourns,
 laments,
 beats his breast,
 wails
 and falls into disillusionment.

 This, [211] monks, is the third (kind of) anguish and dejection
 that the fool experiences
 here and now.
 ■

 He, monks,[10] who is a fool,
 having fared wrongly in body,
 having fared wrongly in speech,
 having fared wrongly in thought,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 Anyone, monks, speaking rightly of him
 would say he is thoroughly undesirable,
 thoroughly disagreeable,
 thoroughly unpleasant,
 as in speaking rightly of Niraya Hell
 he would say it is thoroughly undesirable,
 thoroughly disagreeable,
 thoroughly unpleasant.

 As to this, monks,
 even a simile is not easy,
 so many are the anguishes of Niraya Hell."

 When this had been said,
 a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:

 "But is it possible
 to make a simile for me, revered sir?"

 "It is possible, monk,"
 the Lord said.

 "It is as though, monk,
 men should arrest a thief,
 an evil-doer,
 and bring him before the king,
 with the words:

 'This, sire, is a thief,
 an evil-doer to you.

 Decree for him
 whatever punishment you wish,'

 and the king should speak thus concerning him:

 'Go along, good sirs,
 stab[11] this man early in the morning
 with a hundred spears.'

 And early in the morning
 they would stab him with a hundred spears.

 Then at midday the king would speak thus:

 'My good fellows,
 how is that man?'

 'He is still alive, sire.'

 Then the king would speak thus concerning him:

 'Go along, good sirs,
 stab this man at midday
 with a hundred spears.'

 And at midday they would stab him with a hundred spears.

 Then towards evening
 the king would speak thus:

 'My good fellows,
 how is that man?'
 'He is still alive, sire.'

 Then the king would speak thus concerning him:

 'Go along, good sirs,
 stab this man towards evening
 with a hundred spears.'

 And towards evening
 they would stab him with a hundred spears.

 What do you think about this, monks,
 would not that man,
 while he was being stabbed with three hundred spears,
 from that source experience anguish and dejection?"

 "That man, revered sir,
 being stabbed with only one spear
 from that source would experience anguish and dejection.

 How much more then[12]
 with three hundred spears?"

 [212] Then the Lord,
 having picked up a small stone the size of his hand,
 addressed the monks,
 saying:

 "What do you think about this, monks?

 Now, which is the greater,
 this small stone,
 the size of my hand,
 that I have picked up,
 or the Himalaya,[13] lord of mountains?"
 "This small stone, revered sir,
 that the Lord picked up,
 the size of his hand,
 is insignificant;
 compared with the Himalaya, lord of mountains,
 it does not count,
 it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),
 it cannot even be compared (with it)."[14]

 "Even so, monks, that anguish and dejection
 that that man experiences
 while he is being stabbed with three hundred spears,
 compared with the anguish of Niraya Hell
 does not count,
 it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),
 it cannot even be compared (with it).

 Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 subject him to what is called the fivefold pinion.[15]

 They drive a red-hot iron stake
 through each hand
 and each foot
 and a red-hot iron stake
 through the middle of his breast.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time[16]
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then the guardians of Niraya Hell
 lay him down
 and plane him with adzes.
 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 place him feet up
 and head down
 and plane him with razors.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 bind him to a chariot
 and drive him up and down
 over ground that is burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 push him up and down
 a great mountain slope
 of glowing cinders,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 take him,
 feet up and head down,
 and plunge him into a glowing brazen cauldron,
 burning,
 aflame,
 ablaze.

 There he is boiled
 and rises to the surface with the [213] scum.

 Boiling there
 and rising to the surface with the scum,
 he comes up once
 and goes down once
 and once he goes across.

 Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,
 sharp,
 severe.

 But he does not do his time
 until he makes an end of that evil deed.

 Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell
 toss him into the Great Niraya Hell.
 Now, monks, this Great Niraya Hell[17]
 (is so described):

 Four-cornered and with four gates,[18]
 It is divided into equal portions,
 Encircled by an iron wall, with a roof of iron above;
 Its incandescent floor is made of glowing iron;
 All round it stands a hundred yojanas square.[19]

 In many a disquisition could I, monks,
 talk a talk about Niraya Hell,
 but it is not easy to describe in full,[20] monks,
 so many are the anguishes of Niraya Hell.

 There are, monks, animals,
 breathing creatures
 that are grass-eaters.

 These eat moist and dry grasses,
 chewing them with their teeth.

 And which, monks, are the animals,
 the breathing creatures,
 that are grass-eaters?

 Horses,
 cattle,
 asses,
 sheep,
 deer,
 and whatever other animals,
 breathing creatures
 there are that are grass-eaters.

 Monks, that fool
 who formerly enjoyed tastes here,
 having done evil deeds here,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in companionship
 with those beings that are grass-eaters.

 There are, monks, animals,
 breathing creatures
 that are dung-eaters.

 Having smelt the smell of dung from afar
 they run up,
 thinking:

 'We will eat here,
 we will eat here.'

 Monks, it is like brahmans
 who run up at the smell of a sacrifice,
 thinking:

 'We will eat here,
 we will eat here'
 even so, monks, there are animals,
 breathing creatures
 that are dung-eaters.

 These having smelt the smell of dung from afar
 run up,
 thinking:

 'We will eat here,
 we will eat here.'

 And which, monks arc the animals,
 the breathing creatures
 that are dung-eaters?
 Cocks,
 swine,
 dogs,
 jackals,
 and whatever other animals,
 breathing creatures
 there are
 that are dung-eaters.

 Monks, that fool
 who formerly enjoyed tastes here,

 [214] having done evil deeds here,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in companionship
 with those beings that are dung-eaters.

 There are, monks, animals,
 breathing creatures
 that are born in the dark,
 grow old in the dark
 and die in the dark.

 And which, monks, are the animals,
 the breathing creatures
 that are born,
 grow old
 and die
 in the dark?

 Beetles,
 maggots,
 earth-worms
 and whatever other animals,
 breathing creatures there are
 that are born,
 grow old
 and die
 in the dark.

 Monks, that fool
 who formerly enjoyed tastes here
 having done evil deeds here,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in companionship
 with those beings that are born,
 grow old
 and die in the dark.

 There are, monks, animals,
 breathing creatures
 that are born in water,
 grow old in water,
 die in water.

 And which, monks, are the animals,
 the breathing creatures
 that are born,
 grow old
 and die in water?

 Fishes,
 turtles,
 crocodiles
 and whatever other animals,
 breathing creatures
 there are
 that are born,
 grow old
 and die
 in water.
 Monks, that fool
 who formerly enjoyed tastes here
 having done evil deeds here,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in companionship
 with those beings that are born,
 grow old
 and die
 in water.

 There are, monks, animals,
 breathing creatures
 that are born in filth,
 grow old in filth,
 die in filth.

 And which, monks, are the animals,
 the breathing creatures
 that are born,
 grow old
 and die in filth?

 Those beings, monks,
 that are born in rotting fish
 or that grow old in rotting fish
 or that die in rotting fish;
 that are born in rotting carcases
 or that grow old in rotting carcases
 or that die in rotting carcases;
 that are born in rotting rice
 or that grow old in rotting rice
 or that die in rotting rice;
 that are born in a pool at the entrance to a village
 or that grow old in a pool at the entrance to a village
 or that die in a pool at the entrance to a village;
 that are born in a dirty pool near a village
 or that grow old in a dirty pool near a village
 or that die in a dirty pool near a village.

 Monks, that fool who formerly enjoyed tastes here,
 having done evil deeds here,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in companionship
 with those beings that are born in filth,
 grow old in filth,
 die in filth.

 In many a disquisition could I, monks,
 talk a talk about animal birth,
 but it is not easy to describe in full, monks,
 so many are the anguishes of animal birth.

 Monks, it is like a man
 who might throw a yoke with one hole[21]
 into the sea.

 An easterly wind might take it westwards,
 a westerly wind might take it eastwards,
 a northerly wind might take it southwards,
 a southerly wind might take it northwards.

 There might be [215] a blind turtle there
 who came to the surface
 once in a hundred years.

 What do you think about this, monks?

 Could that blind turtle
 push his neck through that one hole in the yoke?"

 "If at all,[22] revered sir,
 then only once in a very long while."
 "Sooner or later, monks,
 could the blind turtle
 push his neck through the one hole in the yoke;
 more difficult than that,
 do I say, monks,
 is human status once again
 for the fool who has gone to the Downfall.

 What is the cause of that?

 Monks, there is no dhamma-faring there,
 no even-faring,
 no doing of what is skilled,
 no doing of what is good.

 Monks, there is devouring of one another there
 and feeding on the weak.[23]

 Monks, if some time or other
 once in a very long while
 that fool came to human status (again),
 he would be born into those families that are low;[24]
 a family of low caste
 or a family of hunters
 or a family of bamboo-plaiters
 or a family of cartwrights
 or a family of refuse-scavengers,[25]
 in such a family as is needy,
 without enough to drink
 or to eat,
 where a covering for the back
 is with difficulty obtained.

 Moreover, he would be ill-favoured,
 ugly,
 dwarfish,
 sickly,
 blind
 or deformed
 or lame
 or paralysed;
 he would be unable to get food,
 drink,
 clothes,
 vehicles,
 garlands,
 scents and perfumes,
 bed,
 dwelling,
 and lights;
 he would fare wrongly in body,
 wrongly in speech,
 wrongly in thought.

 Because he had fared wrongly in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he would arise in the sorrowful ways,
 a bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 Monks, it is as though a gambler
 at the very first losing throw (at dice)
 were to lose his son,
 his wife
 and all his property
 and, further,
 were to undergo imprisonment himself.
 Insignificant, monks,
 is that losing throw
 by which the gambler
 at the very first losing throw
 were to lose his son,
 his wife
 and all his property
 and, further,
 were to undergo imprisonment himself.

 Greater than this
 is the losing throw
 by which the fool,
 having fared wrongly in body,
 wrongly in speech,
 wrongly in thought,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in the sorrowful ways,
 the bad bourn,
 the Downfall,
 Niraya Hell.

 This, monks, is the fool's condition,
 completed in its entirety.[26]

 §

 [216] These, monks, are the three marks of a wise man,
 signs of a wise man,
 stamps of a wise man.

 What three?
 As to this, monks,
 a wise man is one thinking right thoughts,
 speaking right words,
 and a doer of deeds rightly done.

 If, monks, a wise man
 were not one thinking right thoughts,
 speaking right words,
 a doer of deeds rightly done,
 how could the wise know of him:

 This worthy man is a wise man,
 a true man?

 It is because, monks, a wise man is one thinking right thoughts,
 speaking right words,
 a doer of deeds rightly done,
 that the wise know of him:

 This worthy man is a wise man,
 a true man.

 Monks, he who is a wise man
 experiences a threefold happiness and joy
 here and now.

 If, monks, the wise man is sitting down
 in an assembly room
 or by a carriage road
 or at a cross-roads
 and the people there held appropriate suitable talk about him,
 and if, monks, the wise man
 abstained from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what had not been given,
 from wrong behaviour in regard to the sense-pleasures,
 from lying,
 from occasions for sloth
 consequent upon (drinking) arrack,
 toddy
 and strong liquor,
 and if, monks, it thereupon occurred to the wise man:

 'These people are holding an appropriate suitable talk about me;
 these states exist in me
 and I engage in these states'  this, monks, is the first (kind of) happiness and joy
 that the wise man experiences
 here and now.

 And again, monks, a wise man
 sees kings who having arrested a thief,
 an evil-doer,
 are meting out various punishments:
 they lash him with whips,
 and they lash him with canes,
 and they lash him with (birch) rods,
 and they cut off his hand,
 and they cut off his foot,
 and they cut off his hand and foot,
 and they cut off his his ear,
 and they cut off his his nose,
 and they cut off his his ear and nose,
 and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,
 and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,
 and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,
 and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,
 and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,
 and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,
 and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,
 and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,
 and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,
 and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,
 and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'
 and they spray him with burning oil,
 give him as food to the dogs,
 impale him alive on stakes,
 and they decapitate him with a sword.

 Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the wise man:

 'Because of such and such evil deeds
 kings, having arrested a thief,
 an evil-doer,
 mete out various punishments:
 they lash him with whips,
 and they lash him with canes,
 and they lash him with (birch) rods,
 and they cut off his hand,
 and they cut off his foot,
 and they cut off his hand and foot,
 and they cut off his his ear,
 and they cut off his his nose,
 and they cut off his his ear and nose,
 and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,
 and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,
 and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,
 and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,
 and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,
 and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,
 and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,
 and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,
 and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,
 and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,
 and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,
 and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'
 and they spray him with burning oil,
 give him as food to the dogs,
 impale him alive on stakes,
 and they decapitate him with a sword.

 But these states do not exist in me
 and I do not engage in these states.'

 This, monks, is the second (kind of) happiness and joy
 that the wise man experiences
 here and now.

 And again, monks,
 while a wise man is on a chair
 or bed
 or lying on the ground,
 at such a time
 those lovely deeds that he has formerly rightly done
 by body,
 speech
 and thought
 rest on him,
 lie on him,
 settle on him.

 Monks, as at eventide the shadows of the great mountain peaks rest,
 lie
 and settle
 on the earth,
 so, monks, do those lovely deeds
 that the wise man has formerly rightly done
 by body,

 [217] speech
 and thought
 rest,
 lie
 and settle on him
 as he is on a chair
 or bed
 or lying on the ground.

 Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the wise man:

 'Indeed what is evil
 has not been done by me,
 cruelty has not been done,
 violence has not been done,
 what is lovely has been done,
 what is skilled has been done,
 a refuge against fearful (consequences) has been found.

 Insofar as there is a bourn
 for those who have not done evil,
 cruelty
 or violence,
 who have done what is lovely,
 what is skilled,
 and who have found a refuge
 against fearful (consequences),
 to that bourn I am going hereafter.'

 He does not grieve,
 mourn,
 lament,
 beat his breast,
 wail
 or fall into disillusionment.

 This, monks, is the third (kind of) happiness and joy
 that the wise man experiences
 here and now.

 He, monks, who is a wise man,
 having fared rightly in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Anyone, monks, speaking rightly of him
 would say:

 'Thoroughly desirable,
 thoroughly agreeable,
 thoroughly pleasant,'
 as in speaking rightly of heaven
 he would say:
 'Thoroughly desirable,
 thoroughly agreeable,
 thoroughly pleasant.'

 As to this, monks,
 even a simile is not easy,
 so many are the happinesses of heaven."

 When this had been said,
 a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:

 "But is it possible, revered sir,
 to make a simile?"[27]

 "It is possible, monk,"
 the Lord said.

 "It is as though, monk,
 a wheel-rolling king,[28]
 endowed with seven Treasures
 and four efficacies,[29]
 should experience happiness and joy
 from that source.

 From what seven?

 As to this, monk,
 when a noble anointed king
 has bathed his head on an Observance day,
 the fifteenth,
 and has gone for the Observance
 to an upper storey of his palace,
 there then appears
 the deva-like Treasure of the Wheel
 with its nave,
 its tyres
 and all its thousand spokes complete.

 On seeing it,
 this occurs to the noble anointed king:

 'I have heard this,
 that if a noble anointed king
 has bathed his head on an Observance day,
 the fifteenth,
 and has gone for the Observance
 to an upper storey of his palace,
 and there then appears [218] the deva-like Treasure of the Wheel
 with its nave,
 its tyres,
 and all its thousand spokes complete,
 he becomes a wheel-rolling king.

 May I then be a wheel-rolling king.'

 Then, monks,[30] the noble anointed king
 rising from his seat,
 taking a ceremonial water jar in his left hand,
 with his right sprinkles (water) over[31] the Treasure of the Wheel,
 saying:

 'May the honoured Treasure of the Wheel roll on,
 may the honoured Treasure of the Wheel be all-conquering.'

 Then, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel
 rolls on towards the eastern quarter
 and after it (goes) the wheel-rolling king
 together with a fourfold army.

 And wherever, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel stops,
 there the wheel-rolling king settles down
 together with the fourfold army.

 And, monks, rival kings in the eastern quarter,
 having approached the wheel-rolling king,
 speak thus:

 'Come, sire,
 you are welcome, sire,
 (all is) yours, sire,
 instruct (us), sire.'

 The wheel-rolling king speaks thus:

 'Breathing things should not be killed,
 what has not been given
 should not be taken,
 wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures
 should not be indulged in,
 lies should not be told,
 strong drink should not be drunk,
 and you should eat in moderation.'[32]
 And, monks, those rival kings of the eastern quarter
 become vassals of the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And then, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel,
 plunging into the eastern sea
 and rising out (of it again),
 rolls on to the southern quarter
 and after it (goes) the wheel-rolling king
 together with a fourfold army.

 And wherever, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel stops,
 there the wheel-rolling king settles down
 together with the fourfold army.

 And, monks, rival kings in the southern quarter,
 having approached the wheel-rolling king,
 speak thus:

 'Come, sire,
 you are welcome, sire,
 (all is) yours, sire,
 instruct (us), sire.'

 The wheel-rolling king speaks thus:

 'Breathing things should not be killed,
 what has not been given
 should not be taken,
 wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures
 should not be indulged in,
 lies should not be told,
 strong drink should not be drunk,
 and you should eat in moderation.'
 And, monks, those rival kings of the southern quarter
 become vassals of the wheel-rolling king.

 And then, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel,
 plunging into the southern sea
 and rising out (of it again),
 rolls on to the western quarter
 and after it (goes) the wheel-rolling king
 together with a fourfold army.

 And wherever, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel stops,
 there the wheel-rolling king settles down
 together with the fourfold army.

 And, monks, rival kings in the western quarter,
 having approached the wheel-rolling king,
 speak thus:

 'Come, sire,
 you are welcome, sire,
 (all is) yours, sire,
 instruct (us), sire.'

 The wheel-rolling king speaks thus:

 'Breathing things should not be killed,
 what has not been given
 should not be taken,
 wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures
 should not be indulged in,
 lies should not be told,
 strong drink should not be drunk,
 and you should eat in moderation.'
 And, monks, those rival kings of the western quarter
 become vassals of the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And then, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel,
 plunging into the western sea
 and rising out (of it again),
 rolls on to the northern quarter
 and after it (goes) the wheel-rolling king
 together with a fourfold army.

 And wherever, monks, the Treasure of the Wheel stops,
 there the wheel-rolling king settles down
 together with the fourfold army.

 And, monks, rival kings in the northern quarter,
 having approached the wheel-rolling king,
 speak thus:

 'Come, sire,
 you are welcome, sire,
 (all is) yours, sire,
 instruct (us), sire.'

 The wheel-rolling king speaks thus:

 'Breathing things should not be killed,
 what has not been given
 should not be taken,
 wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures
 should not be indulged in,
 lies should not be told,
 strong drink should not be drunk,
 and you should eat in moderation.'
 And, monks, those rival kings of the northern quarter
 become vassals of the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And then, monks,
 when the Treasure of the Wheel has conquered all the sea-girt earth,
 returning to that royal city itself,
 it stands as if fixed by the axle[33] to the gateway
 of the wheel-rolling king's palace,
 adorning the gateway
 of the wheel- [219] rolling king's palace.

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Wheel
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.

 And again, monks,
 the Treasure of the Elephant
 appears to the wheel-rolling king;
 it is all white,
 seven-fold firm,
 going through the sky by psychic potency,
 an elephant-king named Uposatha.[34]

 On seeing him
 the wheel-rolling king is pleased at heart
 and thinks:

 'Glorious indeed is an elephant-vehicle,
 if he will submit to taming.'

 Then, monks, that Treasure of an Elephant,
 like a fine thoroughbred elephant
 long since well tamed,
 submits to taming then and there.
 Once upon a time, monks,
 the wheel-rolling king,
 while testing that very Treasure of an Elephant,
 mounted it early one morning
 and it passed over the sea-girt earth
 and returned to that royal city itself
 in time for the morning meal.

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Elephant
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 the Treasure of the Horse
 appears to the wheel-rolling king;
 it is all white,
 with a head (as black as) a crow's,
 a dark mane,
 going through the sky by psychic potency,
 a king of horses named Valaha.[35]

 On seeing him
 the wheel-rolling king is pleased at heart
 and thinks:

 'Glorious indeed is a horse-vehicle,
 if he will submit to taming.'

 Then, monks, that Treasure of a Horse,
 like a fine thoroughbred horse
 long since well tamed,
 submits to taming then and there.

 Once upon a time, monks,
 the wheel-rolling king,
 while testing that very Treasure of a Horse,
 mounted it early one morning
 and it passed over the sea-girt earth
 and returned to that royal city itself
 in time for the morning meal.

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Horse
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 the Treasure of the Jewel[36]
 appears to the wheel-rolling king.

 It is an emerald jewel,
 of purest water,
 well cut into eight facets.

 And the light
 of that Treasure of the Jewel, monks,
 is shed all round for a yojana.

 Once upon a time, monks,
 the wheel-rolling king,
 in order to test that very Treasure of the Jewel,
 arrayed the fourfold army,
 raised aloft the jewel
 on the top of a standard
 and went out into the dense darkness of the night.

 And, monks, the villagers all around
 set about their daily work
 by its effulgence,
 thinking it to be day.

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Jewel
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.
 ■

 And again, monks, the Treasure of the Woman
 appears to the wheel-rolling king.

 She is lovely,
 good to look upon,
 charming,
 endowed with the greatest beauty of complexion;
 not too tall,
 not too short,
 not too thin,
 not too stout,
 not too dark,
 not too [220] fair;
 surpassing human beauty,
 though she has not attained deva-like beauty.

 And the touch of the body
 of this Treasure of the Woman
 is such, monks,
 that it is like that of a tuft of cotton
 or a tuft of thistle-down.

 And, monks, the limbs
 of this Treasure of the Woman
 are warm when (the weather) is cool
 and cool when it is warm.

 The perfume of sandal-wood
 is wafted from the body
 of this Treasure of the Woman, monks;
 from her mouth is wafted the perfume of lotuses.

 And this Treasure of the Woman, monks,
 is one to get up earlier than the wheel-rolling king
 and retire later to rest,
 an obedient servant
 carrying out his pleasure,
 speaking affably.[37]

 And, monks,
 that Treasure of the Woman
 is never unfaithful to the wheel-rolling king
 even in thought,
 how then could she be physically?

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Woman
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And again, monks, the Treasure of the Householder[38]
 appears to the wheel-rolling king.

 As a result of kamma
 he has deva-like vision
 by which he sees treasure
 whether it has an owner or not.

 Approaching the wheel-rolling king,
 he speaks thus:

 'Be you untroubled, sire,
 I will deal with your wealth
 as wealth should be dealt with.'

 Once upon a time, monks,
 the wheel-rolling king,
 in order to test this Treasure of the Householder,
 embarked in a boat,
 pushed out into the middle of the stream of the river Ganges,
 and spoke thus to the Treasure of the Householder:
 'I have need, householder,
 of gold coins and gold.'

 'Well then, your majesty,
 let the boat come in to one of the banks.'

 'It is just here, householder,
 that I have need of gold coins and gold.'

 Then, monks,
 that Treasure of the Householder,
 touching the water with both his hands,
 drew up a jar
 full of gold coins and gold
 and spoke thus to the wheel-rolling king:

 'Is this enough, your majesty,
 have I done enough, your majesty,
 is the service enough, your majesty?

 The wheel-rolling king spoke thus:

 It is enough, householder,
 you have done enough, householder,
 the service is enough, householder.'

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Householder
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.

 ■

 And again, monks, the Treasure of the Adviser[39] appears to the wheel- rolling king.

 He is clever,
 experienced,
 wise;
 he is pro- [221] ficient in procuring what should be procured
 for the wheel-rolling king,
 in removing what should be removed,
 in retaining what should be retained.[40]

 Having approached the wheel-rolling king,
 he speaks thus:

 'Be you untroubled, sire,
 I will instruct (you).'

 So, monks, does the Treasure of the Adviser
 appear to the wheel-rolling king.

 The wheel-rolling king, monks,
 is endowed with these seven Treasures.

 And with what four efficacies?[41]

 As to this, monks,
 a wheel-rolling king is lovely,
 good to look upon,
 charming,
 endowed with the greatest beauty of complexion
 surpassing other men's.

 Monks, a wheel-rolling king
 is endowed with this first efficacy.

 ■
 And again, monks, a wheel-rolling king
 is of long life,
 living long,
 surpassing other men.

 Monks, a wheel-rolling king
 is endowed with this second efficacy.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 a wheel-rolling king
 has little illness,
 does not ail,
 is possessed of a good digestion
 that is neither too cold nor too hot,[42]
 surpassing other men's.

 Monks, a wheel-rolling king
 is endowed with this third efficacy.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 a wheel-rolling king
 is dear to brahmans and householders
 and beloved by them.

 As, monks, fathers
 are dear to and beloved by their children,
 so, monks, is a wheel-rolling king
 dear to and beloved by brahmans and householders.

 And, monks, brahmans and householders
 are dear to and beloved by the wheel-rolling king.
 As, monks, children
 are dear to and beloved by their father,
 so, monks, are brahmans and householders
 dear to and beloved by the wheel-rolling king.

 Once upon a time, monks,
 a wheel-rolling king
 went out to a pleasure ground
 with a fourfold army.

 Then, monks, brahmans and householders,
 approaching the wheel-rolling king,
 spoke thus:

 'Go on slowly, sire,
 that we may look on you for longer.'

 And, monks, the wheel-rolling king
 addressed the charioteer,
 saying:

 'Drive on slowly, charioteer,
 that I may look on the brahmans and householders for longer.'

 Monks, a wheel-rolling king
 is endowed with this fourth efficacy.

 [222] Monks, a wheel-rolling king
 is endowed with these four efficacies.

 What do you think about this, monks?

 Does not a wheel-rolling king,
 endowed with these seven Treasures
 and these four efficacies,
 experience happiness and joy from that source?"
 "A wheel-rolling king, revered sir,
 if possessed of only one Treasure
 would experience happiness and joy from that source.

 How much more then
 from seven Treasures
 and four efficacies?"

 Then the Lord,
 having picked up a small stone
 the size of his hand,
 addressed the monks,
 saying:

 "What do you think about this, monks?

 Now which is the greater,
 this small stone,
 the size of my hand,
 that I have picked up,
 or the Himalaya,
 lord of mountains?"

 "This small stone, revered sir,
 that the Lord has picked up,
 the size of his hand,
 is insignificant;
 compared with the Himalaya,
 lord of mountains,
 it does not count,
 it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),
 it cannot even be compared (with it)."

 "Even so, monks,
 that happiness and joy
 that the wheel-rolling king experiences
 from the seven Treasures
 and the four efficacies,
 compared with deva-like happiness
 does not count,
 it does not amount to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),
 it cannot even be compared (with it).

 Monks, if sometime or other
 once in a very long while
 that wise man came to human status,
 he would be born into one of those families that are high:
 a family of rich nobles
 or a family of rich brahmans
 or a family of rich householders,
 in such a family as is well-to-do,
 of great possessions,
 of great resources,
 with abundant gold and silver,
 abundant means,
 abundant wealth in grains.

 Moreover, he would be lovely,
 good to look upon,
 charming,
 endowed with the greatest beauty of complexion;
 he would be able to get food,
 drink,
 clothes,
 vehicles,
 garlands,
 scents and perfumes,
 bed,
 dwelling
 and lights;
 he would fare rightly in body,
 rightly in speech,
 rightly in thought.
 Because he had fared rightly in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 he would arise in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Monks, it is as though a gambler
 at the very first winning throw (at dice)
 were to win a great mass of possessions.

 Insignificant, monks
 is that winning throw
 by which the gambler
 at the very first winning throw
 were to win a great mass of possessions.

 Greater than this
 is the winning throw
 by which the wise man,
 having fared rightly in body,
 rightly in speech,
 rightly in thought,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 arises in a good bourn,
 the [223] heaven world.

 This, monks, is the wise man's condition
 completed in its entirety."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
