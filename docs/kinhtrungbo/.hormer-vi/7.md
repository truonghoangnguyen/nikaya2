# 7. Discourse on the Simile of the Cloth

## Vatthūpama Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered [46] one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, as a cloth is a defilement of the mind,
 that is stained and dirty is a defilement of the mind,
 and which a dyer might dip into this and that dye - is a defilement of the mind,
 be it dark green or yellow or red or crimson - is a defilement of the mind,
 would be dyed a bad colour; is a defilement of the mind,
 it would not be clear in colour.

 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, it is because the cloth was not clean.

 Even so, monks, a bad bourn[2] is to be expected is a defilement of the mind,
 when the mind is stained.

 Monks, as a cloth is a defilement of the mind,
 that is quite clean, is a defilement of the mind,
 quite pure, is a defilement of the mind,
 and which a dyer might dip into this or that dye - is a defilement of the mind,
 be it dark green or yellow or red or crimson - is a defilement of the mind,
 would be dyed a good colour; is a defilement of the mind,
 it would be clear in colour.

 What is the reason for this?

 Monks, it is because the cloth was clean.

 Even so, monks, a good bourn[3] is to be expected is a defilement of the mind,
 when the mind is not stained.

 And what, monks, are the defilements of the mind?

 endowed with knowledge and right conduct,
 well-farer,
 knower of the world(s),
 incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and mankind,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.'

 ■

 He becomes [47] possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma and thinks;

 'Dhamma is well taught by the Lord,
 it is self-realised,
 it is timeless,[5]
 it is a come-and-see thing,
 leading onwards,[6] to be understood individually by the wise.'

 ■

 He becomes possessed of unwavering confidence in the Order and thinks:

 'The Lord's Order of disciples
 is of good conduct,
 the Lord's Order of disciples
 is upright,
 the Lord's Order of disciples
 is of wise conduct,
 the Lord's Order of disciples
 is of dutiful conduct,
 that is to say
 the four pairs of men,
 the eight individuals.[7]

 This Order of the Lord's disciples
 is worthy of alms,
 worthy of hospitality,
 worthy of offerings,
 worthy of reverence,
 it is a matchless field of merit for the world.'[8]

 At this stage[9]
 there is for him giving up,
 renouncing,
 rejecting,
 getting rid of,
 forsaking.

 ■

 He, thinking:

 'Possessed of unwavering confidence in the Awakened One am I,'

 acquires knowledge of the goal,[10]
 acquires knowledge of dhamma,'[11]
 acquires the delight
 that is connected with dhamma;
 rapture is born from that delight,
 being rapturous,
 his body is impassible,
 with the body impassible,
 joy[12] is felt,
 because of joy
 the mind is (well) concentrated.[13]

 ■

 Thinking:
 'Possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma am I,'

 he acquires knowledge of the goal,
 acquires knowledge of dhamma,'
 acquires the delight
 that is connected with dhamma;
 rapture is born from that delight,
 being rapturous,
 his body is impassible,
 with the body impassible,
 joy is felt,
 because of joy
 the mind is (well) concentrated.

 ■

 Thinking:

 'Possessed of unwavering confidence in the Order am I,'

 he acquires knowledge of the goal,
 acquires knowledge of dhamma,'
 acquires the delight
 that is connected with dhamma;
 rapture is born from that delight,
 being rapturous,
 his body is impassible,
 with the body impassible,
 joy is felt,
 because of joy
 the mind is (well) concentrated.

 ■

 Thinking:
 'At this stage
 there comes to be for me
 giving up,
 renouncing,
 rejecting,
 getting rid of,
 forsaking,'

 he acquires knowledge of the goal,
 acquires knowledge of dhamma,'
 acquires the delight
 that is connected with dhamma;
 rapture is born from that delight,
 being rapturous,
 his body is impassible,
 with the body impassible,

 the mind is (well) concentrated.

 [48] A monk, monks, of such moral habit,[14]
 of such dhamma,
 a of such wisdom  even if he eat fine almsfood,
 the black grains removed,
 with various curries,
 various vegetables,[15]
 that will not be a stumbling-block for him.

 ■
 Monks, even as a stained and dirty cloth,
 if put in clear water
 becomes pure and clean,
 or as gold
 put into a smelting-pot
 becomes pure and clean,
 in like manner, monks,
 a monk of such moral habit,
 of such dhamma,
 of such wisdom,
 even if he eat fine almsfood,
 the black grains removed,
 with various curries,
 various vegetables,
 that will not be a stumbling-block for him.

 He dwells, having suffused the first quarter
 with a mind of friendliness,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwells having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of friendliness
 that is far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 He dwells having suffused the first quarter
 with a mind of compassion,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwells having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of compassion
 that is far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 He dwells having suffused the first quarter
 with a mind of sympathetic joy,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwells having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of sympathetic joy
 that is far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 He dwells having suffused the first quarter
 with a mind of equanimity,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwells having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of equanimity
 that is far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 He comprehends:

 'There is this,[16]
 there is a low,[17]
 there is the excellent,[18]
 there is a further escape from perceptions.'[19]

 For one thus knowing,
 thus seeing,
 the mind is freed
 from the canker of sense-pleasures
 and the mind is freed
 from the canker of becoming
 and the mind is freed
 from the canker of ignorance.

 In freedom
 the knowledge comes to be
 that he is freed,
 and he comprehends:

 'Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or such.'

 Monks, this is called a monk
 who is washed
 with an inner washing."[20]

 §

 [49] Now at that time the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai[21] was sitting not far from the Lord.

 Then the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Does the revered Gotama go down to wash in the river Bāhukā?"[22]

 "Brahman, what is there to the river Bāhukā?

 Of what use is the river Bāhuka?"
 "But, good Gotama, the river Bāhukā
 is considered by the many-folk
 as a means of purification,[23]
 the river Bāhukā is considered by the manyfolk
 to be for merit.

 For in the river Bāhukā
 the many-folk wash away
 the evil deeds that have been done."

 Then the Lord addressed the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai in verses:

 "In the Bāhukā, and at Adhikakkā,[24]
 At Gayā,[24] and in the Sundarikā,
 In the Sarassatī, and at Payāga,[25]
 Then in the river Bāhumatī,[26]
 The fool, though entering constantly,
 Does not cleanse his dark deed.[27]

 What can the Sundarikā, do?
 What Payāga, what the Bāhukā river?
 They do not cleanse that hostile guilty man
 Intent on evil deeds.
 For the pure every day is auspicious,
 for the pure every day is holy,[28]

 [50] For the pure of bright deeds[29]
 there is ever the practice of (good) custom.
 Bathe in this only,[30] brahman,
 Make all creatures secure,[31]

 If you do not speak a lie,[32]
 if you harm no living thing,[33]
 If you take not the ungiven,[34]
 are believing, not stingy —
 What can you do by going to Gayā,
 when Gayā is only a well[35] for you?"

 When this had been said,
 the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is excellent, good Gotama;
 it is excellent, good Gotama.

 It is as if, good Gotama,
 one might set upright
 what had been upset,
 or disclose what had been covered,
 or show the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or bring an oil lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision might see material shapes;
 even so
 in many a figure
 has dhamma been made clear by the good Gotama,
 I,
 even I,
 am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,
 and to dhamma,
 and to the Order of monks.

 May I receive the going forth[36]
 in the presence of the good Gotama,
 may I receive ordination."[37]

 Then the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai received the going forth
 in the Lord's presence,
 he received ordination.

 Soon after he had been ordained
 the venerable Bhāradvājai,
 abiding alone,[38]
 aloof,[39]
 diligent,
 ardent,[40]
 self-resolute,[41]
 not long afterwards,
 by his own super-knowledge,
 having precisely here-now[42] realised

 [51] that matchless culmination of the Brahma-faring[43]
 for the sake of which
 young men of family[44]
 rightly go forth from home
 into homelessness,
 abided in it.

 He comprehended:

 Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or such.

 So the venerable Bhāradvājai
 became one of the perfected ones.
