# 108. The Discourse to Ganaka-Moggallāna

## Ganaka-Moggallāna Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:

 At one time, not long after the Lord's parinibbāna, the venerable Ānanda[1]
 was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.

 Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the lady of Videha,
 distrusting King Pajjota,[2]
 was having Rājagaha strengthened.

 Then the venerable Ānanda,
 dressing early in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Rājagaha for almsfood.

 Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:
 "It is still too early to walk for alms in Rājagaha.

 Suppose that I were to approach the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna
 and his place of work?"[3]

 Then the venerable Ānanda approached the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna and his place of work.

 The brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance;
 seeing him he spoke thus to him:

 "Let the good Ānanda come,
 there is a welcome for the good Ānanda.

 It is long since the good Ānanda made this opportunity,
 that is for coming here.

 Let the good Ānanda sit down,
 this seat is made ready."

 And the venerable Ānanda sat down on the appointed seat.

 The brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna,
 taking a low seat,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
 the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:

 "Is there even one monk, Ānanda,
 who is possessed in every way
 and in every part
 of all those things
 of which the good Gotama,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 was possessed?"

 "There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who is possessed in every way
 and in every part
 of all those things
 of which the Lord was possessed,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 For, brahman, this Lord
 was one to make arise a Way
 that had not arisen (before),

 [59] to bring about a Way
 not brought about (before),
 to show a Way
 not shown (before);
 he was a knower of the Way,
 an understander of the Way,
 skilled in the Way.

 But the disciples are now Way-followers
 following after him."[4]

 But this conversation
 between the venerable Ānanda
 and the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna
 was interrupted,
 for the brahman Vassakāra,[5]
 the chief minister in Magadha,
 while inspecting the works near Rājagaha,
 approached the venerable Ānanda
 at the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna's place of work;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Ānanda;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
 the brahman Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,
 spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:

 "What now, Ānanda,
 was the talk for which you were sitting here?

 And what was that talk of yours
 that was interrupted?"

 "As to this, brahman,
 the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna said this to me:

 "Is there even one monk, Ānanda,
 who is possessed in every way
 and in every part
 of all those things
 of which the good Gotama,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 was possessed?"

 When this had been said,
 I, brahman, spoke thus to the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna:

 "There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who is possessed in every way
 and in every part
 of all those things
 of which the Lord was possessed,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 For, brahman, this Lord
 was one to make arise a Way
 that had not arisen (before),
 to bring about a Way
 not brought about (before),
 to show a Way
 not shown (before);
 he was a knower of the Way,
 an understander of the Way,
 skilled in the Way.

 This, brahman, was the conversation that was interrupted
 between the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna and myself.

 For then you arrived."

 "Is there, good Ānanda, even one monk
 who was designated by the good Gotama
 saying:

 'After my passing
 this one will be your support,[6]
 and to whom you might have recourse now?"

 "There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who was designated by the Lord
 who knew and saw,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 saying:
 'After my passing
 this one will be your support,'
 and to whom we might have recourse now."

 ■

 [60] "But is there even one monk, Ānanda,
 who is agreed upon by the Order
 and designated by a number of monks
 who are elders, saying:

 'After the Lord's passing
 this one will be our support,'
 and to whom you might have recourse now?"

 "There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who is agreed upon by the Order
 and designated by a number of monks
 who are elders, saying:

 'After the Lord's passing
 this one will be our support,'
 and to whom you might have recourse now?"

 ■

 "But as you are thus without a support, good Ānanda,
 what is the cause of your unity?"

 "We, brahman, are not without support;
 we have a support, brahman.

 dhamma is the support."[7]

 ■

 "When you were asked:
 'Is there, good Ānanda, even one monk
 who was designated by the good Gotama
 saying:

 "After my passing
 this one will be your support",
 and to whom you might have recourse now?

 you said:

 'There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who was designated by the Lord
 who knew and saw,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 saying:

 "After my passing
 this one will be your support,"
 and to whom we might have recourse now.'

 When you were asked:

 'But is there even one monk, Ānanda,
 who is agreed upon by the Order
 and designated by a number of monks
 who are elders, saying:

 "After the Lord's passing
 this one will be our support,"
 and to whom you might have recourse now?

 you said:

 'There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who is agreed upon by the Order
 and designated by a number of monks
 who are elders, saying:

 "After the Lord's passing
 this one will be our support,"
 and to whom you might have recourse now?'

 When you were asked:

 'But as you are thus without support, good Ānanda,
 what is the cause of your unity?'

 you said:

 'We, brahman, are not without a support;
 we have a support, brahman.

 dhamma is the support.'

 Good Ānanda,
 what meaning is to be ascribed to what has been said?"

 ■

 "There is, brahman, a rule of training laid down,
 an Obligation appointed for monks
 by that Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 On every Observance Day
 we who live depending on the same field and village
 each and all gather together on the same day,
 and when we have gathered together
 we inquire what has happened to each one.
 While this is being told
 if there was an offence,
 a transgression on the part of a monk,
 we have him dealt with
 according to the rule,[8]
 according to the instruction.

 Indeed the revered ones do not deal with us,
 it is the rule[9] that deals with us."

 "Now is there, good Ānanda, even one monk whom you revere,

 [61] reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on whom,
 revering and reverencing him,
 you live in dependence?"

 "There is, brahman, even one monk whom we revere
 reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on whom,
 revering and reverencing him,
 you live in dependence."[10]

 ■

 "When you were asked:

 'Is there, good Ānanda, even one monk
 who was designated by the good Gotama
 saying:

 "After my passing
 this one will be your support",
 and to whom you might have recourse now?

 you said:

 'There is not even one monk, brahman,

 When you were asked:

 'But as you are thus without support, good Ānanda,
 what is the cause of your unity?'

 you said:

 'We, brahman, are not without a support;
 we have a support, brahman.

 dhamma is the support.'

 When you were asked:

 'Now is there, good Ānanda, even one monk whom you revere,
 reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on whom,
 revering and reverencing him,
 you live in dependence?'

 you said:

 'There is, brahman, even one monk whom we revere
 reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on whom,
 revering and reverencing him,
 you live in dependence.'
 Good Ānanda, what meaning is to be ascribed
 to what has been said?"

 "There are, brahman, ten satisfying things[11]
 that have been pointed out by the Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 In whomsoever of us these things exist,
 him do we revere,
 reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on him,
 revering and reverencing him,
 do we live in dependence.

 What are the ten?

 Herein, brahman, a monk is moral,[12]
 he lives controlled
 by the control of the Obligations,
 endowed with (right) behaviour and pasture,
 seeing peril in the slightest faults
 and, undertaking them,
 he trains himself
 in the rules of training.

 He is one who has heard much,
 remembers what he has heard,
 stores up what he has heard;
 those things which are lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle
 and lovely at the ending
 and which, with the meaning and the spirit,
 declare the Brahma-faring
 wholly fulfilled,
 perfectly purified,
 such things are much heard by him,
 borne in mind,
 familiarised by speech,
 pondered over in the mind,
 well penetrated by right view.

 He is content with the requisites
 of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.

 He is one who acquires at will,
 without trouble,
 without difficulty
 the four meditations
 which are of the purest mentality,
 abidings in ease here and now.

 He experiences the various forms of psychic power:

 having been one
 he becomes manifold,
 having been manifold he becomes one;

 manifest or in- [62] visible
 he goes unhindered through a wall,
 a rampart
 or a mountain
 as if through air;

 he plunges into the ground
 and shoots up again
 as if in water;
 he walks upon the water
 without parting it
 as if on the ground;

 sitting cross-legged
 he travels through the air
 like a bird on the wing;

 with his hand
 he rubs and strokes
 this moon and sun
 although they are of such mighty power and majesty;

 and even as far as the Brahma-world
 he has power in respect of his person.

 With the purified deva-like hearing
 surpassing that of men
 he hears both (kinds of) sounds  deva-like ones
 and human ones,
 whether they be far or near.

 ■

 He knows intuitively by mind
 the minds of other beings,
 of other individuals
 so that he comprehends
 of a mind that is full of attachment,
 that it is full of attachment;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is without attachment
 that it is without attachment;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is full of aversion,
 that it is full of aversion;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is without aversion
 that it is without aversion;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is full of confusion,
 that it is full of confusion;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is without confusion;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is contracted,
 that it is contracted;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is distracted,
 that it is distracted;
 or he comprehends of a mind that has become great,
 that it has become great;
 or he comprehends of a mind that has not become great,
 that it has not become great;
 or he comprehends of a mind that has (some other mental state) superior to it,
 that it has (some other mental state) superior to it;
 or he comprehends of a mind that has no (other mental state) superior to it,
 that it has no (other mental state) superior to it;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is composed,
 that it is composed;,
 or he comprehends of a mind that is not composed,
 that it is not composed;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is freed,
 that it is freed;
 or he comprehends of a mind that is not freed,
 that it is not freed.

 ■

 He recollects a variety of former habitations,
 that is to say

 One birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration:

 'Such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where I was such a one by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.'

 Thus he recollects divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail.

 ■

 With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 he sees beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds,
 and thinks:

 'Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.'
 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 does he see beings as they pass hence,
 as they arise;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of deeds.

 By the destruction of the cankers,
 having realised by his own super-knowledge
 here and now
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through intuitive wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 entering thereon he abides therein.

 These, brahman, are the ten satisfying things
 that have been pointed out by the Lord who knows and sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 In whomsoever of us these things exist,
 him do we revere,
 reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on him,
 revering and reverencing him,
 do we live in dependence."

 [63] When this had been said,
 the brahman Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,
 spoke thus to General Upananda;[13]

 "What do you think about this?

 If it is thus, General,
 that these good sirs revere
 what should be revered,
 reverence what should be reverenced,
 esteem what should be esteemed,
 honour what should be honoured,
 then these good sirs most certainly
 revere what should be revered,
 esteem what should be esteemed,
 honour what should be honoured.

 For if these good sirs were not to revere,
 reverence,
 esteem
 or honour
 this (monk),
 then who on earth could these good sirs revere,
 reverence,
 esteem
 and honour
 and on whom,
 revering and reverencing him,
 could they live in dependence?"

 Then Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,
 spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:

 "But where is the good Ānanda staying at present?"

 "I, brahman, am at present staying in the Bamboo Grove."

 "I hope, good Ānanda,
 that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant,
 with little sound,
 little noise,
 sheltered from the winds,
 secluded from the haunts of men
 and suitable for solitary meditation?"

 "Most certainly, brahman,
 the Bamboo Grove is pleasant,
 with little sound,
 little noise,
 sheltered from the winds,
 secluded from the haunts of men,
 suitable for solitary meditation
 as befits a guardian and warden like yourself."

 "Most certainly, good Ānanda,
 the Bamboo Grove is pleasant,
 with little sound,
 little noise,
 sheltered from the winds,
 secluded from the haunts of men,
 suitable for solitary meditation
 as befits meditators
 and those disposed to meditation
 like the revered ones.

 The revered ones are both meditators
 and disposed to meditation.

 At one time, good Ānanda,
 the revered Gotama was staying near Vesalī
 in the Great Wood
 in the hall of the Gabled House.

 Then I, good Ānanda,
 approached the revered Gotama
 in the Great Wood
 in the hall of the Gabled House.

 While he was there
 the revered Gotama in many a figure
 talked a talk on meditation.

 A meditator was the revered Gotama
 and he was disposed to meditation;
 and the revered Gotama
 praised every (form of) meditation."

 "No, brahman,
 the Lord did not praise every (form of) meditation,
 nor did the Lord not praise
 every (form of) meditation.

 What kind of meditation, brahman,
 did the Lord not praise?

 As to this, brahman,
 someone dwells with his thought obsessed
 by attachment to pleasures of the senses,
 overcome by attachment to pleasures [64] of the senses,
 and he does not comprehend
 as it really is
 the escape from the attachment to the pleasures of the senses
 that has arisen;
 he, having made attachment to the pleasures of the senses the main thing,[14]
 meditates on it,
 meditates absorbed,
 meditates more absorbed,
 meditates quite absorbed.[15]

 He dwells with his thought obsessed by ill-will,
 overcome by ill-will,
 and he does not comprehend as it really is
 the escape from ill-will
 that has arisen;
 he, having made ill-will the main thing
 meditates on it,
 meditates absorbed,
 meditates more absorbed,
 meditates quite absorbed.

 He dwells with his thought obsessed by sloth and torpor,
 overcome by sloth and torpor,
 and he does not comprehend as it really is
 the escape from sloth and torpor
 that has arisen;
 he, having made sloth and torpor the main thing
 meditates on it,
 meditates absorbed,
 meditates more absorbed,
 meditates quite absorbed.

 He dwells with his thought obsessed by restlessness and worry,
 overcome by restlessness and worry,
 and he does not comprehend as it really is
 the escape from restlessness and worry
 that has arisen;
 he, having made restlessness and worry the main thing
 meditates on it,
 meditates absorbed,
 meditates more absorbed,
 meditates quite absorbed.

 He dwells with his thought obsessed by doubt,
 overcome by doubt,
 and he does not comprehend as it really is
 the escape from doubt
 that has arisen;
 he, having made doubt the main thing
 meditates on it,
 meditates absorbed,
 meditates more absorbed,
 meditates quite absorbed.

 The Lord does not praise this kind of meditation, brahman.

 And what kind of meditation, brahman,
 does the Lord praise?

 As to this, brahman, a monk,
 aloof from the pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 entering into the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful,
 abides in it.

 And again, brahman, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 And again, brahman, a monk,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 And again, brahman, a monk
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 The Lord praises this kind of meditation, brahman."

 "Indeed, good Ānanda,
 the good Gotama contemned the meditation
 that is contemptible,
 commended that which is commendable.

 But now, if you please, good Ānanda,
 we must be going.

 We are very busy,
 there is much to be done."

 "You, brahman, do that for which you deem it is now the right time."

 Then Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,
 rejoicing in what the venerable Ānanda had said,
 giving thanks,
 rising from his seat departed.
 Then soon after the brahman Vassakāra,
 the chief minister in Magadha,
 had departed,
 the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:

 "The good Ānanda has not[ed1] explained to us what we asked him."

 [65] "Did we not say to you, brahman:

 "There is not even one monk, brahman,
 who is possessed in every way
 and in every part
 of all those things
 of which the Lord was possessed,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 For, brahman, this Lord
 was one to make arise a Way
 that had not arisen (before),
 to bring about a Way
 not brought about (before),
 to show a Way
 not shown (before);
 he was a knower of the Way,
 an understander of the Way,
 skilled in the Way.
