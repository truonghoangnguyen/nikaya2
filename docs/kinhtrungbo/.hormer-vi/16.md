# 16. Discourse on Mental Barrenness[1]

## Cetokhila Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.

 There the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, by whatever monk five mental barrennesses[2] are not got rid of,
 five mental bondages[3] are not rooted out,
 that he should come to growth,
 expansion,
 maturity[4] in this dhamma and discipline  such a situation does not occur.

 Which are the five mental barrennesses
 that are not got rid of by him?

 Herein, monks, the monk has doubts about the Teacher,
 is perplexed,
 is not convinced,
 is not sure.

 Monks, whatever monk has doubts about the Teacher,
 is perplexed,
 is not convinced,
 is not sure,
 his mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 This is the first mental barrenness
 that thus comes not to be got rid of
 by him whose mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 ■

 And again, monks, the monk has doubts about Dhamma,
 is perplexed,
 is not convinced,
 is not sure,
 his mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 This is the second mental barrenness
 that thus comes not to be got rid of
 by him whose mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 ■

 And again, monks, the monk has doubts about the Order,
 is perplexed,
 is not convinced,
 is not sure,
 his mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 This is the third mental barrenness
 that thus comes not to be got rid of
 by him whose mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 ■

 And again, monks, the monk has doubts about the training,
 is perplexed,
 is not convinced,
 is not sure,
 his mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 This is the fourth mental barrenness
 that thus comes not to be got rid of
 by him whose mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 ■

 And again, monks, a monk comes to be angry,
 displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers,
 the mind worsened,
 barren.[5]

 Monks, whatever monk comes to be angry,
 displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers,
 his mind worsened,
 barren,
 his mind does not incline to [133] ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 This is the fifth mental barrenness
 that thus comes not to be got rid of
 by him whose mind does not incline to ardour,
 to continual application,
 to perseverance,
 to striving.

 These are the five mental barrennesses that are not got rid of.
 §

 And what are the five mental bondages that are not rooted out in him?

 In this case, monks, a monk is not without attachment to sense-pleasures,
 not without desire,

 aspiring after some class of devas, thinking:

 'By this moral habit

 I will become a deva[8]
 or one among the devas.[8]

 §

 He cultivates the basis of psychic power[9]
 that is possessed of concentration of intention
 with activities of striving;

 he cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of energy
 with activities of striving;

 he cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of consciousness
 with activities of striving;

 he cultivates the basis of psychic power
 that is possessed of concentration of investigation
 with activities of striving,

 with exertion as the fifth.

 ■
 Monks, if a monk is thus possessed of fifteen factors
 including exertion[10]
 he becomes one[11] for successful breaking through,[12]
 he becomes one for awakening,
 he becomes one for winning
 the incomparable security from the bonds.[13]

 ■

 Monks, [136] it is as if[14] there were
 eight
 or ten
 or a dozen
 hen's eggs
 properly sat on,
 properly incubated,
 properly hatched
 by that hen;
 such a wish as this would not arise in that hen:

 'O may my chicks,
 having pierced through the egg-shells
 with the point of the claw on their feet
 or with their beaks,
 break forth safely,'
 for these chicks were ones
 who were able to break forth safely
 having pierced through the egg-shells
 with the point of the claw on their feet
 or with their beaks.

 Even so, monks,
 is it that a monk who is thus possessed of the fifteen factors
 including exertion
 becomes one for successful breaking through,
 he becomes one for awakening,
 he becomes one for winning
 the incomparable security from the bonds."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
