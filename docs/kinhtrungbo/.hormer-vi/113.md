# 113. Discourse on the Good Man

## Sappurisa Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I will teach you, monks, dhamma of good men and dhamma of bad men.

 Listen to it,
 pay careful attention
 and I will speak."
 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "And what, monks, is dhamma of good men?

 As to this, monks,
 a bad man has gone forth from a high family.[1]

 He reflects thus:

 'I have gone forth from this high family;
 but these other monks
 have not gone forth from a high family.'

 Because he belongs to a high family
 he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man, monks, reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's belonging to a high family
 that things of [90] greed,
 things of aversion,
 things of confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not gone forth from a high family,
 one may still fare along
 in complete accordance with dhamma,
 may fare along correctly,
 may be a farer according to dhamma,
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,[2]
 neither exalts himself for belonging to a high family
 nor disparages others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 Again, monks, a bad man has gone forth from a great family.[3][4]

 He reflects thus:

 'I have gone forth from this great family;
 but these other monks
 have not gone forth from a great family.'

 Because he belongs to a great family
 he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man, monks, reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's belonging to a great family
 that things of greed,
 things of aversion,
 things of confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not gone forth from a great family,
 one may still fare along
 in complete accordance with dhamma,
 may fare along correctly,
 may be a farer according to dhamma,
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for belonging to a great family
 nor disparages others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 Again, monks, a bad man has gone forth from a very rich family.

 He reflects thus:

 'I have gone forth from this very rich family;
 but these other monks
 have not gone forth from a very rich family.'

 Because he belongs to a very rich family
 he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man, monks, reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's belonging to a very rich family
 that things of greed,
 things of aversion,
 things of confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not gone forth from a very rich family,
 one may still fare along
 in complete accordance with dhamma,
 may fare along correctly,
 may be a farer according to dhamma,
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for belonging to a very rich family
 nor disparages others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 Again, monks, a bad man has gone forth from an eminent family.

 He reflects thus:

 'I have gone forth from this very eminent family;
 but these other monks
 have not gone forth from an eminent family.'

 Because he belongs to an eminent family
 he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man, monks, reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's belonging to an eminent family
 that things of greed,
 things of aversion,
 things of confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not gone forth from an eminent family,
 one may still fare along
 in complete accordance with dhamma,
 may fare along correctly,
 may be a farer according to dhamma,
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for belonging to an eminent family
 nor disparages others.

 This, too monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man is well-known,
 famous.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am well-known,
 famous,
 but these other monks are little known,
 of no esteem.'[5]

 Because of his being well-known he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's being well-known
 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not well-known,
 famous,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being well-known
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 acquires the requisites of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.

 He reflects [91] thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the requisites of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the requisites of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick.'

 Because of these acquisitions he exalts himself, disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's being an acquirer of the requisites of robe- material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not an acquirer of the requisites of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'

 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being an acquirer of the requisites of robe- material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 is one who has heard much.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am one who has heard much,
 but these other monks are not ones who has heard much.'

 Because of these acquisitions he exalts himself, disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:
 'It is not because of one's being one who has heard much,

 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not one who has heard much,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'

 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being one who has heard much,
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 is one who is expert in Vinaya.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am one who is expert in Vinaya,
 but these other monks are not ones who are expert in Vinaya.'

 Because of being expert in Vinaya he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's being one who is expert in Vinaya,

 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not one who is expert in Vinaya,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'

 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being one who is expert in Vinaya,
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 is one who is a speaker on dhamma.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am one who is a speaker on dhamma,
 but these other monks are not ones who are speakers on dhamma.'

 Because of being a speaker on dhamma he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's being a speaker on dhamma,

 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.
 For even if one be not a speaker on dhamma,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'

 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being one who is a speaker on dhamma,
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 is one who is a forest-dweller[6].

 He reflects thus:

 'I am one who is a forest-dweller,
 but these other monks are not ones who are forest-dwellers.'

 Because of being a forest-dweller he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's being a forest-dweller,

 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not a forest-dweller,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being one who is a forest-dweller,
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 is one who is a wearer of robes taken from the dust-heap.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am one who is a wearer of robes taken from the dust-heap,
 but these other monks are not ones who are wearers of robes taken from the dust-heap.'

 Because of being a wearer of robes taken from the dust-heap he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's being a wearer of robes taken from the dust-heap,

 that things of greed,
 aversion,
 confusion
 go to destruction.

 For even if one be not a a wearer of robes taken from the dust-heap,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'
 He, having made the course itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself for being one who is a wearer of robes taken from the dust-heap,
 nor disparages others.

 For even if one be not a beggar for alms,
 one may still fare along in complete accordance with dhamma
 and therefore be one to be honoured and commended.'

 He, having made the course itself the main thing,

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man

 Because of being one who stays at the root of a tree he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'It is not because of one's staying at the root of a tree,

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man

 [92] Because of being one who eats once (a day only) he exalts himself,

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man,
 aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the first meditation,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the first meditation.'

 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the first meditation he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.
 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire[7]
 even for the attainment of the first meditation
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the first meditation
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the second meditation,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the second meditation.'

 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the second meditation he exalts himself,

 it is otherwise.

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the second meditation
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the third meditation,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the third meditation.'
 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the third meditation he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire
 even for the attainment of the third meditation
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.'

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the third meditation
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the fourth meditation,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the fourth
 meditation.'

 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the fourth meditation he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire
 even for the attainment of the fourth meditation
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.

 He, having [93] made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the fourth meditation
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 by wholly transcending perception of material shapes,
 by the going down of perception of sensory reactions,
 by not attending to perception of variety,
 thinking:
 'Ether is unending,'
 enters on
 and abides in the plane of infinite ether.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the plane of infinite ether,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the plane of
 infinite ether.'

 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the plane of infinite ether he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire
 even for the attainment of the plane of infinite ether
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the plane of infinite ether
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man
 by wholly transcending the plane of infinite ether,
 thinking:
 'Consciousness is unending,'
 enters on
 and abides in
 the plane of infinite consciousness.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the plane of infinite consciousness,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the plane of
 infinite consciousness.'

 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the plane of infinite consciousness he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire
 even for the attainment of the plane of infinite consciousness
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the plane of infinite consciousness
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man,
 by wholly transcending the plane of infinite consciousness,
 thinking:
 'There is not anything,'
 enters on
 and abides in
 the plane of no-thing.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the plane of no-thing,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the plane of no thing.'

 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the plane of no-thing he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire
 even for the attainment of the plane of no-thing
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the plane of no-thing
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a bad man,
 by wholly transcending the plane of no-thing,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am an acquirer of the attainment of the plane of neither-perception-nor- non-perception,
 but these other monks are not acquirers of the attainment of the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'
 Because of being one who acquires the attainment of the plane of neither- perception-nor-non-perception he exalts himself,
 disparages the others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a bad man.

 But a good man reflects thus:

 'Lack of desire
 even for the attainment of the plane of neither-perception-nor-non- perception
 has been spoken of by the Lord;
 for whatever they imagine it to be,
 it is otherwise.

 He, having made lack of desire itself the main thing,
 neither exalts himself on account of that attainment of the plane of neither- perception-nor-non-perception
 nor disparages others.

 This too, monks, is dhamma of a good man.

 ■

 And again, monks, a good man,
 by wholly transcending the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the stopping of perception and feeling;
 and having seen by intuitive wisdom,
 his cankers are caused to be destroyed.[8]

 And [94] monks, this monk does not imagine
 he[9] is aught
 or anywhere
 or in anything."[10]
 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
