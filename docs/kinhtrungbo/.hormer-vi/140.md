# 140. Discourse on the Analysis of the Elements

## Dhātu-Vibhaṅga Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord, walking on tour among the people of Magadha, arrived at Rājagaha and approached the potter, Bhaggava;[1]
 having approached, he spoke thus to Bhaggava the potter:

 "If it is not inconvenient to you, Bhaggava,
 I would spend one night in your dwelling."

 "It is not convenient to me, revered sir.
 For there is here one gone forth
 who came before you to stay.
 But if he allow it, do stay, revered sir,
 according to your pleasure."

 [238] At that time there was a young man of family called Pukkusāti[2]
 who had gone forth from home into homelessness
 through faith in the Lord.
 He it was that had arrived first at that potter's dwelling.
 Then the Lord approached the venerable Pukkusāti
 having approached, he spoke thus to the venerable Pukkusāti:

 "If it is not inconvenient to you, monk,
 I will spend a night in the dwelling."

 "Spacious,[3] friend,[4] is the potter's dwelling;
 let the venerable one stay according to his pleasure."

 Then the Lord, having entered the potter's dwelling
 and laid down a spreading of grass to one side,
 sat down cross-legged,
 keeping his back erect
 and arousing mindfulness in front of him.

 And the Lord passed much of that night sitting down.

 And the venerable Pukkusāti too
 spent much of that night sitting down.

 Then it occurred to the Lord:

 "This young man of respectable family
 certainly comports himself pleasantly.
 Suppose I were to question him?"

 And the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Pukkusāti:

 "On account of whom have you, monk, gone forth?
 Who is your teacher?
 Whose dhamma do you profess?"

 "There is, friend, the recluse Gotama,
 son of the Sakyans,
 gone [286] forth from the Sakyan clan;
 concerning this Lord Gotama a lovely reputation has gone abroad thus:
 He is indeed Lord, perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 endowed with (right) conduct and knowledge,
 well-farer,
 knower of the world(s),
 matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and mankind,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 On account of this Lord have I gone forth,
 and this Lord is my teacher;
 I profess this Lord's dhamma."

 "But where, monk, is this Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 staying now?"

 "There is a town called Sāvatthī, friend,
 in the northern districts;
 this Lord, perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One
 is now staying there."

 "Have you, monk, ever seen this Lord?
 If you saw him would you know him?"

 [239] "No, friend, I have never seen this Lord,
 so I would not know him if I saw him."

 Then it occurred to the Lord:

 "This young man of respectable family
 has gone forth on account of me.
 Suppose I were to teach him dhamma?"
 And the Lord addressed the venerable Pukkusāti, saying:

 I will teach you dhamma, monk;
 listen carefully, pay attention and I will speak."

 "Yes, friend,"
 the venerable Pukkusāti answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monk, this man has six elements,
 six fields of (sense-)impingement,
 eighteen mental ranges,[5]
 four resolves.[6]

 Where there is stability,
 conceit and boasting do not continue in existence,
 and when they do not continue in existence
 the sage is said to be at peace.

 He[7] should not be slothful in wisdom,
 he should guard the truth,
 cultivate relinquishment,[8]
 and train himself for peace itself.[9]

 This is the exposition of the analysis of the six elements:

 [287] Monk, when it is said:
 'This man has six elements,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 To the element of extension,
 the liquid element,
 the element of radiation,
 of motion,
 of ākāsa,
 of consciousness.
 Monk, when it is said,
 'This man has six elements,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 Monk, when it is said:
 'This man has six fields of (sense-)impingement,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 To the field of visual impingement,
 of auditory impingement,
 of olfactory impingement,
 of gustatory impingement,
 of tactile impingement,
 of mental impingement.

 Monk, when it is said:
 'This man has six fields of (sense-)impingement,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 Monk, when it is said:
 'This man has eighteen mental ranges,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 Having seen a material shape with the eye,
 one ranges over the material shape that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the material shape that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the material shape that gives rise to equanimity.

 [240] Having heard a sound with the ear,
 one ranges over the sound that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the sound that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the sound that gives rise to equanimity.

 Having smelt a smell with the nose,
 one ranges over the smell that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the smell that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the smell that gives rise to equanimity.
 Having savoured a taste with the tongue,
 one ranges over the taste that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the taste that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the taste that gives rise to equanimity.

 Having felt a touch with the body,
 one ranges over the touch that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the touch that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the touch that gives rise to equanimity.

 Having cognised a mental state with the mind,
 one ranges over the mental state that gives rise to joy,
 ranges over the mental state that gives rise to sorrow,
 ranges over the mental state that gives rise to equanimity.

 Thus there are six ranges for joy,
 six for sorrow,
 six for equanimity.

 Monk, when it is said:
 'This man has eighteen mental ranges,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 Monk, when it is said:
 'This man has four resolves,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 To the resolve for wisdom,
 the resolve for truth,
 the resolve for relinquishment,
 the resolve for calm.

 Monk, when it is said
 'This man has four resolves,'
 it is said in reference to this.
 Monk, when it is said:
 'He should not be slothful in wisdom,
 he should guard the truth,
 cultivate relinquishment
 and train himself for peace itself,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 And how, monk, is one not slothful in wisdom?

 There are these six elements:
 the element of extension,
 the liquid element,
 the element of radiation,
 of motion,
 of ākāsa,
 of consciousness.

 And what, monk, is the element of extension?[10]

 The element of extension may be internal, it may be external.

 And what, monk, is the internal element of extension?

 Whatever is hard, solid, is internal,
 referable to an individual and derived therefrom,
 that is to say:
 the hair of the head,
 the hair of the body,
 nails,
 teeth,
 skin,
 flesh,
 sinews,
 bones,
 marrow of the bones,
 kidneys,
 heart,
 liver,
 pleura,
 spleen,
 lungs,
 intestines,
 mesentery,
 stomach,
 excrement,
 or whatever other thing is hard, solid, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 or derived therefrom
 — this, monk, is called the internal element of extension.

 Whatever is the internal element of [288] extension
 and whatever is the external element of extension,
 just these are the element of extension.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this should be seen as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of extension,
 he cleanses his mind of the element of extension.

 And what, monk, is the liquid element?

 The liquid element may be internal,

 [241] it may be external.

 And what, monk, is the internal liquid element?
 Whatever is liquid, fluid, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 that is to say:
 bile,
 phlegm,
 pus,
 blood,
 sweat,
 fat,
 tears,
 serum,
 saliva,
 mucus,
 synovial fluid,
 urine
 or whatever other thing is liquid, fluid, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 this, monk, is called the internal liquid element.

 Whatever is an internal liquid element
 and whatever is the external liquid element,
 just these are the liquid element.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this should be seen as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the liquid element,
 he cleanses his mind of the liquid element.
 And what, monk, is the element of radiation?

 The element of radiation may be internal, it may be external.

 And what, monk, is the internal element of radiation?

 Whatever is heat, warmth, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 such as that by which one is vitalised
 and that by which one is consumed,
 and that by which one is burnt up,
 and that which one has munched, drunk, eaten and tasted
 which is properly transformed (in digestion),
 or whatever other thing is heat, warmth, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 or derived therefrom,
 this, monk, is called the internal element of radiation.

 Whatever is an internal element of radiation
 and whatever is the external element of radiation,
 just these are the element of radiation.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this should be seen as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of radiation,
 he cleanses his mind of the element of radiation.

 And what, monk, is the element of motion?

 The element of motion may be internal, it may be external.
 And what, monk, is the internal element of motion?

 Whatever is motion, wind, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 such as winds going upwards,
 winds going downwards,
 winds in the abdomen,
 winds in the belly,
 winds that shoot across the several limbs,
 in-breathing,
 out-breathing,
 or whatever other thing is motion, wind, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 this, monk, is called the internal element of motion.

 Whatever is an internal element of motion
 and whatever is the external element of motion,
 just these are the element of motion.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this should be seen as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of motion,
 he cleanses his mind of the element of motion.

 [289] And what, monk, is the element of space?

 The element of space may be internal, it may be external.

 And what, monk, is the internal [242] element of space?
 Whatever is space, spacious, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 such as the auditory and nasal orifices,
 the door of the mouth
 and that by which one swallows
 what is munched, drunk, eaten and tasted,
 and where this remains,
 and where it passes out (of the body) lower down,
 or whatever other thing is space, spacious, is internal,
 referable to an individual
 and derived therefrom,
 this, monk, is called the internal element of space.

 Whatever is an internal element of space
 and whatever is the external element of space,
 just these are the element of space.

 By means of perfect intuitive wisdom
 this should be seen as it really is, thus:
 This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self.

 Having seen this thus as it really is
 by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,
 he disregards the element of space,
 he cleanses his mind of the element of space.

 And when the consciousness that remains is quite pure, quite clean,
 he knows something by means of that consciousness:
 he discriminates pleasure
 and he discriminates pain
 and he discriminates what is neither painful nor pleasant.
 If, monk, because of impingement
 there arises an experience of pleasure
 it it is a pleasant feeling.

 He, experiencing that pleasant feeling,
 comprehends that he is experiencing a pleasant feeling.

 On the cessation of the impingement
 whence comes that experience of pleasure he comprehends:
 'The pleasant feeling arisen on account of an impingement
 experienced as a complemental[11] pleasant experience
 is stopped, is allayed.'

 If, monk, because of impingement
 there arises an experience of pain
 it it is a painful feeling.

 He, experiencing that painful feeling,
 comprehends that he is experiencing a painful feeling.

 On the cessation of the impingement
 whence comes that experience of pain he comprehends:
 'The painful feeling arisen on account of an impingement
 experienced as a complemental painful experience
 is stopped, is allayed.'

 If, monk, because of impingement
 there arises an experience of what is neither painful nor pleasant
 it is a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.

 He, experiencing that feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,
 comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.

 On the cessation of the impingement
 whence comes that experience of what is neither painful nor pleasant he comprehends:
 'The feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant
 arisen on account of an impingement
 experienced as a complemental experience that is neither painful nor pleasant
 is stopped, is allayed.'

 Monk, it is like the heat obtained,
 the light produced
 from the contact and friction of two sticks;
 when the two sticks are separated
 their complemental heat is stopped, is allayed.

 Even so, monk, [290] [243] does a pleasant feeling arise
 on account of the impingement of an experience of pleasure.

 He, experiencing that pleasant feeling,
 comprehends that he is experiencing a pleasant feeling.

 On the cessation of the impingement
 whence comes that experience of pleasure he comprehends:
 'The pleasant feeling arisen on account of an impingement
 experienced as a complemental pleasant experience
 is stopped, is allayed.'

 Even so, monk, does a painful feeling arise
 on account of the impingement of an experience of pleasure.

 He, experiencing that painful feeling,
 comprehends that he is experiencing a painful feeling.

 On the cessation of the impingement
 whence comes that experience of pain he comprehends:
 'The painful feeling
 arisen on account of an impingement
 experienced as a complemental painful experience
 is stopped, is allayed.'
 Even so, monk, does a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant arise
 on account of the impingement of an experience of what is neither painful nor pleasant.

 He, experiencing that feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,
 comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.

 On the cessation of the impingement
 whence comes that experience of neither painful nor pleasant feeling he comprehends:
 'The feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant
 arisen on account of an impingement
 experienced as a complemental experience
 that is neither painful nor pleasant is stopped,
 it is allayed.'

 And further, the equanimity that remains
 is quite pure, quite cleansed,
 soft and pliable and resplendent.

 Monk, it is like a skilled goldsmith or a goldsmith's apprentice preparing a furnace;
 when he has prepared the furnace
 he lights the smelting-pot;
 when he has lit the smelting-pot
 he takes up the gold with tongs
 and places it in the smelting-pot;
 and then from time to time he blows on it,
 from time to time he sprinkles water over it,
 and from time to time he looks at it carefully
 — that gold becomes clear, pure, cleansed,
 (the impurities) removed,
 free from dross,
 soft and pliable and resplendent
 so that whatever kind of ornament one requires,
 a ring or earring or necklace or golden garland,
 it is suitable for that purpose.

 Even so, monk, the equanimity that then remains
 is quite pure, quite cleansed,
 soft and pliable and resplendent.

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of infinite ether
 and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 then would this equanimity,
 supported by this,
 nourished by this,
 stand firm in me for a very long time.

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of infinite consciousness

 [244] and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 then would this equanimity,
 supported by this,
 nourished by this,
 stand firm in me for a very long time.

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of no-thing
 and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 then would this equanimity,
 supported by this,
 nourished by this,
 stand firm in me for a very long time.
 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
 and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 then would this equanimity,
 supported by this,
 nourished by this,
 stand firm in me
 for a very long time.

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of infinite ether
 and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 this[12] is constructed.'[13]

 He therefore [291] neither constructs nor thinks out[14] for becoming or for de-becoming.[15]

 Not constructing, not thinking out for becoming or for de-becoming,
 he grasps after nothing in the world;
 not grasping, he is not troubled,
 being untroubled he himself is individually attained to Nibbāna,
 and he comprehends:
 'Destroyed is birth, brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of infinite consciousness
 and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 this is constructed.'
 He therefore neither constructs nor thinks out for becoming or for de- becoming.

 Not constructing, not thinking out for becoming or for de-becoming,
 he grasps after nothing in the world;
 not grasping, he is not troubled,
 being untroubled he himself is individually attained to Nibbāna,
 and he comprehends:
 'Destroyed is birth, brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of no-thing.

 He comprehends thus:
 'If I should focus this equanimity,
 purified thus, cleansed thus,
 on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
 and should develop my thought in accordance with that,
 this is constructed.'

 He therefore neither constructs nor thinks out for becoming or for de- becoming.

 Not constructing, not thinking out for becoming or for de-becoming,
 he grasps after nothing in the world;
 not grasping, he is not troubled,
 being untroubled he himself is individually attained to Nibbāna,
 and he comprehends:
 'Destroyed is birth, brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'
 If he experience a pleasant feeling
 he comprehends that it is impermanent
 he comprehends that it is not to be cleaved to
 he comprehends that it is not an object of enjoyment.

 If he experience a painful feeling
 he comprehends that it is impermanent
 he comprehends that it is not to be cleaved to
 he comprehends that it is not an object of enjoyment.

 If he experience a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,
 he comprehends that it is impermanent
 he comprehends that it is not to be cleaved to
 he comprehends that it is not an object of enjoyment.

 If he experience a pleasant feeling,
 then detached from it he experiences it.

 If he experience painful feeling
 then detached from it he experiences it.

 If he experience a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,
 then detached from it he experiences it.

 Experiencing a feeling that is limited by the body,[16]
 he comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is limited by the body.

 [245] Experiencing a feeling that is limited by the life-principle
 he comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is limited by the life- principle.

 He comprehends that on the breaking up of the body
 after the life-principle has come to an end
 all enjoyable experiences here will become cool.[17]

 [292]Monk, as an oil-lamp burns
 on account of the oil and on account of the wick
 but goes out[18] from lack of fuel
 if the oil and the wick come to an end
 and no others are brought,
 even so, monk,
 experiencing a feeling that is limited by the body
 he comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is limited by the body;
 experiencing a feeling that is limited by the life-principle
 he comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is limited by the life- principle.

 He comprehends that
 on the breaking up of the body
 after the body has come to an end
 all enjoyable experiences here will become cool.

 He comprehends that
 on the breaking up of the body
 after the life-principle has come to an end
 all enjoyable experiences here will become cool.

 Therefore a monk, endowed thus,
 is endowed with this highest resolve for wisdom.

 For this, monk, is the highest ariyan wisdom,
 that is to say the knowledge of the complete destruction of anguish.

 That freedom of his,
 founded on truth,
 is unshakable.

 For that which is liable to falsity, monk, is falsehood;
 that truth which is not liable to falsity is Nibbāna.

 Therefore, endowed thus a monk is endowed with this highest resolve for truth.
 For this, monk, is the highest Ariyan truth,
 that is to say Nibbāna
 that is not liable to falsity.

 Verily, his former[19] foolish clingings[20] are ended and done with.

 These are got rid of by him,
 cut off at the root,
 made like a palm-tree stump
 that can come to no future growth.

 Therefore, endowed thus,
 a monk is endowed with this highest resolve for relinquishment.

 For this, monk, is the highest Ariyan relinquishment,
 that is to say the casting away of all clingings.

 His former foolish covetousness was passionate desire.

 This is got rid of by him,
 cut off at the root,
 made like a palm-tree stump that can come to no future growth.

 His former foolish hostility was malevolence and corruption.

 This is got rid of by him,
 cut off at the root,
 made like a palm-tree stump
 that can come to no future growth.

 His former foolish ignorance was confusion and corruption.

 This is got rid of by him,
 cut off at the root,

 [246] made like a palm-tree stump
 that can come to no future growth.
 Therefore, endowed thus,
 a monk is endowed with this highest resolve for calm.

 For this, monk, is the highest Ariyan calm,
 that is to say
 the calm in regard to attachment, hatred and confusion.

 When it is said, 'One [293] should not be slothful is wisdom,
 he should guard the truth,
 cultivate relinquishment
 and train himself for peace itself,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 Monk, when it is said,
 'Where there is stability,
 conceit and boasting do not continue in existence,
 and when they do not continue in existence
 the sage is said to be at peace,'
 in reference to what is it said?

 'I am,' monk, this is a supposition.

 'This am I' monk, this is a supposition.

 'I will be' monk, this is a supposition.

 'I will not be' monk, this is a supposition.

 'I will be possessed of form' monk, this is a supposition.

 'I will be incorporeal' monk, this is a supposition.

 'I will be possessed of perception' monk, this is a supposition.

 'I will be possessed of neither perception nor non-perception,' this is a supposition.
 A supposition, monk, is an ill,
 a supposition is an imposthume,
 a supposition is a barb.

 Monk, when he has gone beyond all suppositions
 the sage is said to be at peace.

 But, monk, a sage who is at peace
 is not born,
 does not age,
 is not agitated,
 does not envy.

 As there is nothing by which he can be born,
 how, monk, not being born
 could he age?

 Not ageing, how could he die?

 Not dying, how could he be agitated?

 Not being agitated, how could he envy?

 When it is said:
 'Where there is stability,
 conceit and boasting do not continue in existence,
 and when they do not continue in existence
 the sage is said to be at peace,'
 it is said in reference to this.

 Do you, monk, remember my analysis in brief[21] of the six elements."

 Then the venerable Pukkusāti thought:
 "Indeed it is the Teacher that has come to me;
 indeed it is the Well-farer that has come to me;
 indeed it is the Fully Self-Awakened One that has come to me,"
 and rising from his seat,
 arranging his robe over one shoulder
 and bowing his head to the Lord's feet,
 he spoke thus to the Lord:

 "A transgression, revered sir, has overcome me[22] in that
 foolish, errant and [247] unskilled as I was,
 I supposed the Lord could be addressed with the epithet 'friend.'

 Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge my transgression as a transgression
 for the sake of restraint in the future."

 "Indeed, monk, a transgression overcame you
 in that foolish, errant and unskilled as you were,
 you supposed I could be addressed with the epithet 'friend.'

 But if you, monk, seeing this transgression as a transgression,
 confess it according to the rule,
 we acknowledge it for you.
 For this is growth, monk, in the discipline for an Ariyan,
 that whoever, seeing a transgression as a transgression,
 confesses it according to rule,
 he comes to restraint in the future."

 "Revered sir, may I receive ordination in the Lord's presence?"

 "But are you, monk, complete as to bowl and robe?"

 "Revered sir, I am not complete as to bowl and robe."

 "Monk, Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone not complete as to bowl and robe."

 Then the venerable Pukkusāti,
 having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,
 having given thanks for it,
 rising from his seat
 greeted the Lord and,
 keeping his right side towards him,
 departed in order to search for a bowl and robe.

 But while he was touring about in search of a bowl and robe,
 a cow swerved[23] and deprived him of life.

 Then a number of monks approached the Lord;
 having approached, having greeted the Lord,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.
 As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,
 these monks spoke thus to the Lord:

 'That young man of family, Pukkusāti, revered sir,
 whom the Lord exhorted with an exhortation in brief, has died.[24]
 What is his bourn,
 what his future state?"

 "Clever,[25] monk, was Pukkusāti,
 the young man of family;
 he followed after dhamma
 according to the various parts of dhamma,
 and he did not annoy me with questionings about dhamma.

 Monks, Pukkusāti, the young man of family,
 by the complete destruction of the five fetters binding to this lower (shore),
 is of spontaneous uprising,
 one who attains Nibbāna there,
 not liable to return from that world."
