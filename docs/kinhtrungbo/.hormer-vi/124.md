#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 who had formerly been a friend of the venerable Bakkula
 when he was a householder,
 approached the venerable Bakkula;
 having approached
 and exchanged greetings of courtesy and friendliness
 with the venerable Bakkula
 be sat down at a respectful distance.

 As Kassapa the Unclothed was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 he spoke thus to the venerable Bakkula:
 "How long is it since you, reverend Bakkula, went forth?"

 "It must be eighty years, friend,
 since I went forth."

 "And how many times during these eighty years
 have you, reverend Bakkula,

 Not long after he had been ordained,
 living alone,
 aloof,
 diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 the venerable Kassapa having soon attained here and now [174] through his own super-knowledge
 that incomparable goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home into homelessness,
 entering on it,
 abided in it.

 And he knew:

 "Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so."
 And the venerable Kassapa was one of the perfected ones.

 and going from dwelling-place to dwelling-place,
 spoke thus:

 "Let the venerable ones come forward,
 let the venerable ones come forward,
 today I will attain final nibbāna."[28] ["Inasmuch as the venerable Bakkula took his key

 as he was sitting in the midst of the Order of monks,[29]
 attained final nibbāna. ["Inasmuch as that the venerable Bakkula,
