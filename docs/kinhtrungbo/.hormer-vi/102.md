# 102. Discourse on the Threefold Five[1]

## Pañca-t-taya Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "There are, monks, some recluses and brahmans[2] who,
 conjecturing about the future,[3]
 speculating about the future,
 in many a figure
 maintain assertions concerning the future.[4]

 [1] Some maintain[5] that after dying
 the self, unimpaired,[6] perceives.[7]

 [2] Some maintain[8] that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, does not perceive.

 [3] Some maintain[9] that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, neither perceives nor does not perceive.

 [4] They lay down[10] the cutting off,
 the destruction,
 the [16] disappearance[11] of the essential being.[12]

 [5] Or some maintain there is nibbāna here and now.[13]

 [1 (1-3)]Thus they lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, is existent.[14]

 [2 (4)] Or they lay down the cutting off,
 the destruction,
 the disappearance of the essential being.

 [3 (5)] Or some maintain
 that there is nibbāna here and now.

 Thus these (theories),
 having been five
 become three,
 having been three become five.

 This is the exposition of the three fives.
 [1]

 As to this, monks,
 those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, perceives
 these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 has form;[15]

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 both has and has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 neither has nor has not form.

 ■

 Or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives unity;[16]
 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives diversity;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives the limited;[17]

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives the immeasurable.

 But some of these maintain
 that this consciousness-device[18]
 when gone beyond
 is immeasurable,
 imperturbable.

 ■

 As to this, monks, the Tathāgata comprehends
 that there are those worthy recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, perceives;

 and that these worthy recluses and brahmans
 either lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 has form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 has not form;
 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 both has and has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 neither has nor has not form.

 ■

 Or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives unity;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives diversity;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives the limited;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, perceiving and unimpaired,
 perceives the immeasurable.

 ■

 Or (he comprehends) which of these (forms of) perception
 is pointed out [17] as absolutely pure,
 the highest,
 the best,
 the pre-eminent:

 whether perception of fine-materiality,[19]
 perception of immateriality,[20]
 perception of unity
 or perception of diversity.

 ■

 Saying:

 'There is no-thing,'[21]

 some maintain that the plane of no-thing-ness
 is immeasurable,
 imperturbable.

 Knowing that what is constructed[22]
 is gross-material,[23]
 but that there is this
 that is the stopping of the constructions,[24]
 the Tathāgata,
 seeing the escape from it,[25]
 has gone beyond it.

 [2]

 As to this, monks,
 those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, does not perceive
 these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 has form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 both has and has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 neither has nor has not form.

 ■

 As to this, monks,
 some revile those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self perceives and is unimpaired.

 What is the reason for this?

 They say,

 'Perception is an ill,
 perception is an imposthume,
 perception is a barb;
 this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say non-perception.'

 ■

 As to this, monks,
 the Tathāgata comprehends
 that there are those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, does not perceive;

 and that these recluses and brahmans
 either lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 has form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 both has and has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, not perceiving and unimpaired,
 neither has nor has not form.

 ■

 Monks, this situation does not occur
 that any recluse or brahman could say:
 'Apart from material shape,
 apart from feeling,
 apart from perception,
 apart from the habitual tendencies,
 apart from consciousness,
 I will lay [18] down
 a coming
 or a going
 or a deceasing
 or an uprising
 or expansion
 or maturity.'[26]

 ■

 Knowing that what is constructed
 is gross-material,
 but that there is this
 that is the stopping of the constructions,
 the Tathāgata,
 seeing the escape from it,
 has gone beyond it.

 [3]

 As to this, monks,
 those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, neither perceives nor does not perceive these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, neither perceiving nor not perceiving and unimpaired,
 has form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, neither perceiving nor not perceiving and unimpaired,
 has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, neither perceiving nor not perceiving and unimpaired,
 both has and has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, neither perceiving nor not perceiving and unimpaired,
 neither has nor has not form.

 ■

 As to this, monks,
 some revile those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self perceives and is unimpaired,
 and some also revile
 those worthy recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, does not perceive.

 What is the reason for this?

 They say:

 'Perception is an ill,
 an imposthume,
 a barb;
 lack of perception is confusion;
 this is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say
 neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'

 ■

 As to this, monks, the Tathāgata comprehends
 that there are those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired,
 neither perceives nor does not perceive;

 and that these recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired,
 neither perceiving nor not perceiving,
 either has form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired,
 neither perceiving nor not perceiving,
 has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired,
 neither perceiving nor not perceiving,
 both has and has not form;

 or these worthy recluses and brahmans
 lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired,
 neither perceiving nor not perceiving,
 neither has nor has not form.

 Yet whoever are the recluses and brahmans
 who lay down the acquiring of this plane
 merely through the activities[27]
 of what is to be seen,
 heard,
 experienced,
 cognised  this is shown, monks,
 as destructive to acquiring that plane.

 For it is not this plane, monks,
 that is shown to be attainable
 by attainments which have the constructions present;
 this plane is shown, monks,
 to be attainable
 by attainments where no constructions remain.[28]

 Knowing that what is constructed[29] is gross-material,
 but that there is this
 that is the stopping of the constructions,
 the Tathāgata,
 seeing the escape from it,
 has gone, beyond it.

 [4]

 As to this, monks,
 those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down the cutting off,
 the destruction,
 the disappearance of the essential being  as to this, monks,
 some revile those recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, perceives;
 and some also [19] revile those worthy recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, does not perceive;
 and some also revile those worthy recluses and brahmans
 who lay down that after dying
 the self, unimpaired, neither perceives nor does not perceive.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is that all these worthy recluses and brahmans
 loftily maintain attachment[30] itself,
 saying:

 'We will be such hereafter,
 we will be such hereafter.'[31]

 It is as though a merchant
 who has gone out trading
 should think,

 'I will have this from there,
 I will get this from that'
 even so methinks
 these worthy recluses and brahmans
 are like the merchant
 when they say,

 'We will be such hereafter,
 we will be such hereafter.'
 ■

 As to this, monks, the Tathāgata comprehends:

 Those worthy recluses and brahmans
 who lay down the cutting off,
 the destruction,
 the disappearance
 of the essential being,
 these,
 afraid of their own body,
 loathing their own body,
 simply keep running
 and circling round
 their own body.

 Just as a dog[32]
 that is tied by a leash
 to a strong post
 or stake
 keeps running
 and circling round
 that post
 or stake,
 so do these worthy recluses and brahmans,
 afraid of their own body,
 loathing their own body,
 simply keep running
 and circling round
 their own body.

 Knowing that what is constructed
 is gross-material,
 but that there is this
 that is the stopping of the constructions,
 the Tathāgata,
 seeing the escape from it,
 has gone beyond it.

 Whatever recluses and brahmans, monks,
 conjecturing about the future,
 speculating about the future,
 in many a figure maintain assertions concerning the future,
 all maintain precisely these five positions,[33] or one of them.

 §

 There are, monks,
 some recluses and brahmans
 who, conjecturing about the past,
 speculating about the past,
 in many a figure maintain assertions concerning the past.

 [1] Some maintain,
 'Eternal is self and the world,[34]
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [2] Some maintain,
 'Not eternal is self and the world,[35]
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'
 [3] Some maintain,
 'Both eternal and not eternal is self and the world[36]
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [4] Some maintain,

 [20] 'Neither eternal nor not eternal is self and the world[37]
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [5] Some maintain,
 'Having an end is self and the world[38]
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [6] Some maintain,
 'Not having an end is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [7] Some maintain,
 'Both having an end and not having an end is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [8] Some maintain,
 'Neither having an end nor not having an end is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [9] Some maintain,
 'Perceptive of unity is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'
 [10] Some maintain,
 'Perceptive of diversity is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [11] Some maintain,
 'Perceptive of the limited is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [12] Some maintain,
 'Perceptive of the immeasurable is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [13] Some maintain,
 'Exclusively happy is self and the world[39]
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [14] Some maintain,
 'Exclusively sorrowful is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [15] Some maintain,
 'Happy and sorrowful is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'

 [16] Some maintain,
 'Not sorrowful nor happy is self and the world
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood.'
 Monks, as for those recluses and brahmans
 who speak thus
 and are of this view:

 'Eternal is self and the world,
 this is indeed the truth,
 all else is falsehood'
 this situation cannot occur
 that, apart from faith,
 apart from inclination,
 apart from tradition,
 apart from consideration of reasons,
 apart from reflection on
 and approval of some view,
 knowledge will become thoroughly pure for each one,
 thoroughly cleansed.[40]

 If, monks, knowledge is not thoroughly pure for each one,
 not thoroughly cleansed,
 even that mere fraction of knowledge
 that these worthy recluses and brahmans thoroughly cleanse,
 even that is pointed out as grasping
 on the part of these worthy recluses and brahmans.

 §
 In this case,[41] monks, some recluse or brahman
 by casting out speculation concerning the past
 and by casting out speculation concerning the future,
 by not throughout fixing his mind on the fetters of the senses,
 entering on the rapture of aloofness,[42]
 abides therein.

 He thinks,

 'This is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say,
 entering on the rapture of aloofness
 I am abiding therein.'

 But if that rapture of aloofness of his
 is stopped,[43]
 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness
 sorrow arises;
 from the stopping of sorrow,
 the rapture of aloofness arises.

 As, monks,
 the heat of the sun
 suffuses whatever the shade quits,
 as the shade suffuses whatever the heat of the sun quits,
 even so, monks,
 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness,
 sorrow arises;
 from the stopping of sorrow,
 the rapture of aloofness arises.

 As to this, monks,
 the Tathāgata comprehends:
 'This worthy recluse or brahman
 by casting out speculation concerning the past
 and by casting out speculation concerning the future,
 by not throughout fixing his mind on the fetters of the senses,
 entering on the rapture of aloofness,
 abides therein.

 He thinks,

 'This is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say,

 I am abiding therein.'

 But if that rapture of aloofness of his
 is stopped,
 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness
 sorrow arises;
 from the stopping of sorrow,
 the rapture of aloofness arises.

 As, monks,
 the heat of the sun
 suffuses whatever the shade quits,
 as the shade suffuses whatever the heat of the sun quits,
 even so, monks,
 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness,
 sorrow arises;

 [22] from the stopping of sorrow,
 the rapture of aloofness arises.

 Knowing that what is constructed is gross-material,
 but that there is this

 seeing the escape from it,
 has gone beyond it.

 §

 But in this case, monks,
 some recluse or brahman
 by casting out speculation concerning the past
 and by casting out speculation concerning the future,
 by not throughout fixing his mind on the fetters of the senses,
 by passing beyond the rapture of aloofness,
 entering on spiritual happiness,[44]
 abides therein.

 He thinks:

 'This is the real,
 this the excellent,
 that is to say,
 entering on spiritual happiness
 I am abiding therein.'

 But if that spiritual happiness of his is stopped,
 from the stopping of spiritual happiness
 there arises the rapture of aloofness;
 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness
 spiritual happiness arises.

 As, monks,
 the heat of the sun
 suffuses whatever the shade quits,
 as the shade suffuses whatever the heat of the sun quits,
 even so, monks,
 from the stopping of spiritual happiness
 there arises the rapture of aloofness;
 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness
 spiritual happiness arises.

 As to this, monks,
 the Tathāgata comprehends:

 'This worthy recluse or brahman,by casting out speculation concerning the past
 and by casting out speculation concerning the future,
 by not throughout fixing his mind on the fetters of the senses,
 by passing beyond the rapture of aloofness,
 entering on spiritual happiness,

 as the shade suffuses whatever the heat of the sun quits,
 even so, monks,

 from the stopping of the rapture of aloofness
 spiritual happiness arises.

 Knowing that what is constructed is gross-material,
 but that there is this
 that is the stopping of the constructions,
 the Tathāgata,
 seeing the escape from it,
 has gone beyond it.

 He thinks:

 But if that feeling of his

 there arises a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.

 As, [23] monks,

 beholds,

 'Tranquil am I,
 allayed am I,
 without grasping am I.'

 As to this, monks, the Tathāgata comprehends:

 This worthy recluse or brahman,

 and by casting out speculation concerning the future,
 by not throughout fixing his mind on the fetters of the senses,
 by passing beyond the rapture of aloofness,

 beholds,

 'Tranquil am I,
 allayed am I,
 without grasping am I.' —

 certainly this venerable one
 maintains the very course
 that is suitable for nibbāna.[46]

 On the other hand,
 that worthy recluse or brahman,
 grasping,
 either grasps after speculation concerning the past[47]
 or, grasping,
 grasps after speculation concerning the future[48]
 or, grasping,
 grasps after a fetter of the senses
 or, grasping,
 grasps after the rapture of aloofness
 or, grasping,
 grasps after spiritual happiness
 or, grasping,
 grasps after feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.
 And inasmuch as this venerable one beholds,

 'Tranquil am I,
 allayed am I,
 without grasping am I,'

 this too is shown as a grasping
 on the part of that [24] worthy recluse or brahman.

 Knowing that what is constructed is gross-material,
 but that there is this
 that is the stopping of the constructions,
 the Tathāgata,
 seeing the escape from it,
 has gone beyond it.

 §

 But now, monks,
 this incomparable matchless path to peace[49]
 was awakened to by the Tathāgata,
 that is to say,
 having known the arising
 and the setting
 and the satisfaction
 and the peril
 of the six fields of sensory impingement
 and the escape as it really is,
 there is deliverance
 without grasping.[50]

 And as, monks,
 this incomparable matchless path to peace
 was awakened to by the Tathāgata,
 that is to say,
 having known the arising
 and the setting
 and the satisfaction
 and the peril
 of the six fields of sensory impingement
 and the escape as it really is,
 there is deliverance without grasping."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
