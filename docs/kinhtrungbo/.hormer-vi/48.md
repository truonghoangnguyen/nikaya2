# 48. Discourse at Kosambī[1]

## Kosambīya Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Kosambī
 in Ghosita's monastery.

 Now at that time, the monks of Kosambī,
 disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,[2]
 lived wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.[3]

 They neither convinced one another
 nor came to be convinced themselves,
 nor did they win one another over
 or come to be won over themselves.[4]
 Then a certain monk approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 that monk spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Now, Lord, the monks of Kosambī,
 disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,
 live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.

 They neither convinced one another
 nor came to be convinced themselves,
 nor did they win one another over
 or come to be won over themselves."

 Then the Lord addressed a certain monk,
 saying:

 "Come you, monk,
 summon these monks in my name,
 saying:

 'The Teacher is summoning you.'"

 "Yes, Lord,"
 and this monk,
 having answered the Lord in assent,
 approached those monks;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to those monks:

 "The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones."
 "Yes, your reverence,"
 and those monks
 having answered that monk in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus
 to those monks
 as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "Is it true, as is said, that you, monks,
 are disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,
 and live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.

 That you neither convince one another
 nor came to be convinced yourselves,
 that you neither win one another over
 nor are won over yourselves?"

 [384] "Yes, Lord."

 "What do you think about this, monks?

 At the time when you,
 disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,
 live wounding one another
 with the weapon of the tongue,
 is a friendly act of body[5] offered[6] your fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private?
 Is a friendly act of speech offered your fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private?

 Is a friendly act of thought offered your fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private?

 "No, Lord."

 "Then it is to be said, monks,
 that at that time when you,
 disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,
 live wounding one another
 with the weapons of the tongue  at that time no friendly act of body is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private
 no friendly act of speech is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private
 no friendly act of thought
 is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,
 either in public or in private.

 Therefore, knowing what,
 seeing what,
 is it that you,
 foolish men,
 disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,
 live wounding one another
 with the weapons of the tongue?

 You neither convince one another
 nor are convinced yourselves,
 neither do you win one another over
 nor are won over yourselves.

 So this, foolish men,
 will be for a long time
 for your woe and sorrow."

 Then the Lord addressed the monks,
 saying:

 "Monks, these six things
 are to be remembered;[7]
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 they conduce to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 to harmony
 and unity.

 What six?

 Herein, monks, a monk should offer his fellow Brahma-farers
 a friendly act of body
 both in public and in private.

 This is a thing to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduces to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 harmony
 and unity.
 ■

 And again, monks,
 a monk should offer a friendly act of speech
 both in public and in private.

 This is a thing to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduces to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 harmony
 and unity.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 a monk should offer a friendly act of thought
 both in public and in private.

 This is a thing to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduces to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 harmony
 and unity.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 whatever those lawful acquisitions,
 lawfully acquired,
 if they be even but what is put into the begging bowl  a monk should be one to enjoy sharing such acquisitions,
 to enjoy them in common
 with his virtuous fellow Brahma-farers.
 This too is a thing to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduces to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 harmony
 and unity.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 whatever those moral habits that are faultless,
 without flaw,
 spotless,
 without blemish,
 freeing,
 praised by wise men,
 untarnished,
 conducive to concentration  a monk should dwell united in virtues such as [385] these
 with his fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private.

 This too is a thing to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduces to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 harmony
 and unity.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 whatever view is ariyan,[8]
 leading onwards,
 leading him who acts according to it
 to the complete destruction of anguish  a monk should dwell united in a view such as this
 with his fellow Brahma-farers,
 both in public and in private.

 This too is a thing to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduces to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 harmony
 and unity.

 Monks, these are the six things to be remembered,
 making for affection,
 making for respect,
 which conduce to concord,
 to lack of contention,
 to harmony and unity.

 And, monks,
 of these six things to be remembered,
 this is the topmost,
 this the roof-plate,
 this the dome,[9]
 that is to say
 whatever view is ariyan,
 leading onwards,
 leading him who acts according to it
 to the complete destruction of anguish.
 As, monks, in a house with a peaked roof,
 this is the topmost,
 the roof-plate,
 the dome,
 that is to say the peak,
 even so, monks,
 of these six things to be remembered,
 this is the topmost,
 this the roof-plate,
 this the dome,
 that is to say
 whatever view is ariyan,
 leading onwards,
 leading him who acts according to it
 to the complete destruction of anguish.

 And what, monks, is that view
 which is ariyan,[10]
 leading onwards,
 and which leads him who acts according to it
 to the complete destruction of anguish?

 Herein, monks,
 a monk who is forest-gone
 or gone to the root of a tree
 or gone to an empty place,
 reflects like this;

 'Now, have I a subjective obsession,
 not got rid of,
 owing to which I,
 if my mind were obsessed by it,
 could not know,
 could not see
 (things) as they really are?
 If, monks, a monk is obsessed
 by addiction to sense-pleasures,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk is obsessed
 by malevolence,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk is obsessed
 by sloth and torpor,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk is obsessed
 by restlessness and worry,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk is obsessed
 by doubt, to this extent is his mind obsessed,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk centres his thought
 on this world,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk centres his thought
 on the world beyond,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 If, monks, a monk, disputatious,
 quarrelsome,
 contentious,
 lives wounding with the weapons of his tongue,
 to this extent is his mind obsessed.

 ■

 He comprehends thus:
 'I have no subjective obsession,
 not got rid of,
 owing to which I,
 if my mind were obsessed by it,

 [386] could not know,
 could not see
 (things) as they really are;
 my thought is well directed
 towards awakening as to the truths.'

 This is the first knowledge won by him,
 ariyan,
 transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 And again, monks,
 the ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'While I am following,
 developing,
 maturing this view,
 I gain calm for myself,
 I gain quenchedness[11] for myself.'

 ■

 He comprehends thus:

 'While I am following,
 developing,
 maturing this view,
 I gain calm for myself,
 I gain quenchedness for myself.[12]

 This is the second knowledge won by him,
 ariyan,
 transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Is there another recluse or brahman  outside here  who is possessed of a view
 such as I am possessed of?'

 He comprehends thus:

 'There is no other recluse or brahman  outside here  who is possessed of a view
 such as I am possessed of.'

 This is the third knowledge won by him,
 ariyan, transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 ■

 And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Am I too possessed
 of the kind of propriety
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with right view?'

 And what kind of propriety, monks,
 is a man possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?
 This is propriety, monks,
 for a man endowed with (right) view:

 Whatever kind of offence he falls into
 he makes known the removal[13] of such an offence,
 for he confesses it,
 discloses it,
 declares it quickly to the Teacher
 or to intelligent fellow Brahma-farers;
 having confessed,
 disclosed
 and declared it,
 he comes to restraint in the future.[14]

 Just as an innocent little baby
 lying on its back
 quickly draws back its hand or foot
 if it has touched a live ember  even so, monks,
 this is propriety
 for a man endowed with (right) view:

 Whatever kind of offence he falls into
 he makes known the removal of such an offence,
 for he confesses it,
 discloses it,
 declares it quickly to the Teacher
 or to intelligent fellow Brahma-farers;
 having confessed,
 disclosed
 and declared it,
 he comes to restraint in the future.

 He comprehends thus:
 'I too am possessed
 of the kind of propriety
 which a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view.'

 This is the fourth knowledge won by him,
 ariyan,
 transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 ■

 [387] And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Am I too possessed
 of the kind of propriety
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?'

 And what kind of propriety, monks,
 is a man possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?

 This is propriety, monks,
 for a man endowed with (right) view:

 If he is zealous
 concerning those manifold things[15]
 which are to be done for fellow Brahma-farers,
 he then becomes of strong aspiration
 for training in the higher moral habit,
 for training in the higher thought,
 for training in the higher intuitive wisdom.

 Just as a cow with a young calf,
 while she is pulling the grass
 keeps an eye on the calf even so, monks, this is propriety
 for a man endowed with (right) view:

 If he is zealous
 concerning those manifold things
 which are to be done for fellow Brahma-farers,
 he then becomes of strong aspiration
 for training in the higher moral habit,
 for training in the higher thought,
 for training in the higher intuitive wisdom.

 He comprehends thus:

 'I too am possessed
 of the kind of propriety
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view.'

 This is the fifth knowledge won by him,
 ariyan,
 transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Am I too possessed
 of the kind of strength
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?

 And what kind of strength, monks,
 is a man possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?

 This is strength, monks,
 for a man endowed with (right) view:
 While dhamma and discipline
 proclaimed by the Tathāgata
 are being taught,
 having applied himself,
 paying attention,
 concentrating with all the mind,
 he listens to dhamma with ready ear.[16]

 He comprehends thus:

 'I too am possessed
 of the kind of strength
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view.'

 This is the sixth knowledge won by him,
 ariyan,
 transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 ■

 And again, monks,
 the ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Am I too possessed
 of the kind of strength
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?

 And what kind of strength, monks,
 is a man possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view?

 This is strength, monks,
 for a man endowed with (right) view:
 While dhamma and discipline
 proclaimed by the Tathāgata
 are being taught,
 he acquires knowledge of the goal,
 he acquires knowledge of dhamma,
 he acquires the rapture that is connected with [388] dhamma.[17]

 He comprehends thus:

 'I too am possessed
 of the kind of strength
 a man is possessed of
 who is endowed with (right) view.'

 This monks, is the seventh knowledge won by him,
 ariyan,
 transcendental,
 not in common with average men.

 Thus, monks, propriety
 has come to be well sought by an ariyan disciple
 who is possessed of seven factors
 for realising the fruit of stream-attainment.

 Possessed of seven factors thus, monks,
 an ariyan disciple is possessed of the fruit of stream-attainment."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
