SUTTA 13

[^200]: MA: "Full understanding" (pariññaā) here means overcoming (samatikkama) or abandoning (pahāna). The wanderers of other sects identify the full understanding of sensual pleasures with the first jhāna, the full understanding of material form with the immaterial planes of being, and the full understanding of feelings with the impercipient plane of being. The Buddha, in contrast, describes the full understanding of sensual pleasures as the path of the non-returner, and the full understanding of both material form and feelings as the path of arahantship.

[^201]: MA gives a graphic description of each of these forms of torture.

[^202]: It should be noted that while the previous dangers in sensual pleasures were called "a mass of suffering visible here and now" (sanditthiko dukkhakkhandho), this one is called "a mass of suffering in the life to come" (samparāyiko dukkhakkhandho).

[^203]: MA says that Nibbāna is the removal and abandonment of desire and lust for sensual pleasures, for in dependence on Nibbāna, desire and lust are removed and abandoned. It might also be taken to include the path of the non-returner, which accomplishes the abandoning of desire and lust for sensual pleasures.

[^204]: To expose the danger in feelings, the Buddha chooses the most refined and exalted type of mundane pleasure, the bliss and peacefulness of the jhānas, and shows that even those states are impermanent and therefore unsatisfactory.
