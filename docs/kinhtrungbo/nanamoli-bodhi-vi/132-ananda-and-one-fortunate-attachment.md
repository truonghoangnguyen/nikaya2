# 132 Ānanda and One Fortunate Attachment
***(Ānandabhaddekaratta Sutta)***

1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇ̣̣ika's Park.

2. Now on that occasion the venerable Ānanda was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging [190] the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly hall. He was reciting the summary and exposition of "One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment."

Then, in the evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on a seat made ready and asked the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly hall? Who has been reciting the summary and exposition of 'One Who has One Fortunate Attachment'?"

"It was the venerable Ānanda, venerable sir."

Then the Blessed One asked the venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, how were you instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma, and reciting the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"

§3-10$. "I was doing so thus, venerable sir: [191]

'Let not a person revive the past...

(Repeat the whole of the last sutta, §§3-10 up to:)

Who has one fortunate attachment.'

3. "I was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma thus, and reciting the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment' thus."

"Good, good, Ānanda! It is good that you were instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the

Dhamma thus, and reciting the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment' thus:

12-19. "Let not a person revive the past...

(Repeat the whole of the last sutta, §§3-10 up to:)

Who has one fortunate attachment."

That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ānanda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.
