# 65. Discourse to Bhaddāli

## Bhaddāli Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was [108] there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I, monks, partake of my food at one session.[1]

 Partaking of my food at one session,
 I, monks, am aware of good health
 and of being without illness
 and of buoyancy
 and strength
 and living in comfort.

 Come, do you too, monks,
 partake of your food at one session.

 Partaking of your food at one session,
 you too, monks, will be aware of good health,
 of being without illness,
 of buoyancy
 and strength
 and living in comfort."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:

 "I, revered sir, am not capable[2] of eating my food at one session;
 revered sir, if I ate my food at one session,
 I might have scruples,[3]
 I might have misgivings."

 "Well then, you, Bhaddāli,
 having eaten one portion there where you were invited,
 having taken another portion away,
 might eat that too;
 so could you, Bhaddāli, eating thus, keep yourself going."

 "I, revered sir, am not capable of eating in this fashion;
 even eating so, revered sir,
 I might have scruples,
 I might have misgivings."

 Then the venerable Bhaddāli,
 while a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord,[4]
 while the Order of monks was undertaking the training,
 made known his inability.

 Then the venerable Bhaddāli
 did not see the Lord face to face
 for an entire three months
 because he was one who did not carry out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.

 Now at that time a number of monks
 were making up robe-material for the Lord,
 and they said:

 "When the Lord's robe-material is settled,[5]
 he will set out on a three months tour."

 Then the venerable Bhaddāli approached these monks;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with these monks;
 having conversed in a [109] friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 These monks spoke thus to the venerable Bhaddāli
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "Reverend Bhaddāli,
 this robe-material is being made up for the Lord.

 When the robe-material is settled,
 the Lord will set out on a three months tour.

 Please, reverend Bhaddāli,
 pay careful attention to this opportunity,[6]
 lest later it is more difficult for you."

 "Yes, your reverences,"
 and the venerable Bhaddāli, having answered these monks in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me,
 foolish,
 misguided
 and wrong that I was,
 inasmuch as I made known an inability
 when a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord
 and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training.

 Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression
 as a transgression
 for the sake of restraint in the future,"

 "Indeed, Bhaddāli, a transgression overcame you,
 foolish,
 misguided
 and wrong that you were,
 inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me
 and while the training was being undertaken by the Order of monks,
 you made known your inability.

 At that time
 this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli:

 The Lord is staying near Sāvatthī
 and the Lord will know of me
 that the monk named Bhaddāli
 is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.[7]
 At that time
 this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli.

 Nor at that time
 was this realised by you, Bhaddāli:

 A number of monks
 who have come to Sāvatthī for the rains
 will also know of me
 that the monk named Bhaddāli
 is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.

 At that time
 this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli.

 Nor at that time
 was this realised by you, Bhaddāli:

 A number of nuns
 who have come to Sāvatthī for the rains
 will also know of me
 that the monk named Bhaddāli
 is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.

 At that time
 this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli.

 Nor at that time
 was this realised by you, Bhaddāli:

 A number of layfollowers who are living in Sāvatthī
 will also know of me
 that the monk named Bhaddāli
 is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.
 At that time
 this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli.

 Nor at that time
 was this realised by you, Bhaddāli:

 A number of women layfollowers who are living in Sāvatthī
 will also know of me
 that the monk named Bhaddāli
 is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.

 At that time
 this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli.

 Nor at that time
 was this realised by you, [110] Bhaddāli:

 A number of recluses and brahmans belonging to other sects who have come to Sāvatthī for the rains
 will also know of me
 that the monk named Bhaddāli
 is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.

 At that time
 this was not realised by you either Bhaddāli.

 "Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me,
 foolish,
 misguided
 and wrong that I was,
 inasmuch as I made known an inability
 when a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord
 and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training.

 Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression
 as a transgression
 for the sake of restraint in the future,"

 "Indeed, Bhaddāli,
 a transgression overcame you,
 foolish,
 misguided
 and wrong that you were,
 inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me
 and while the training was being undertaken by the Order of monks,
 you made known your inability.

 What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 freed both ways[8]
 to whom I might speak thus:

 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself[9]
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 freed through intuitive wisdom
 to whom I might speak thus:
 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 a mental realiser[10]
 to whom I might speak thus:

 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 won to view
 to whom I might speak thus:

 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"
 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 freed through faith
 to whom I might speak thus:

 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 who strives after dhamma
 to whom I might speak thus:

 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 There might be a monk here,
 who strives after faith,[11]
 to whom I might speak thus:
 'Come you, monk,
 be a causeway for me across the mire.'

 Would he make a causeway of himself
 or would he twist his body in another (direction),
 or would he say 'No'?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "What do you think about this, Bhaddāli?

 At that time were [111] you, Bhaddāli,
 freed both ways
 or freed through intuitive wisdom
 or a mental realiser
 or one that had won to view
 or one freed through faith
 or one striving after dhamma
 or one striving after faith?"

 "Not this, revered sir."

 "At that time were not you, Bhaddāli,
 empty,
 void,
 fallen short?"[12]

 "Yes, revered sir.

 "Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me,
 foolish,
 misguided
 and wrong that I was,
 inasmuch as I made known an inability
 when a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord
 and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training.

 Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression
 as a transgression
 for the sake of restraint in the future,"

 "Indeed, Bhaddāli,
 a transgression overcame you,
 foolish,
 misguided
 and wrong that you were,
 inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me
 and while the training was being undertaken by the Order of monks,
 you made known your inability.

 But since you, Bhaddāli,
 see the transgression
 as a transgression
 and confess it according to the rule,[13]
 we acknowledge it for you.

 For, Bhaddāli, in the discipline for an ariyan,
 this is growth:
 whoever, seeing a transgression
 as a transgression,
 confesses according to the rule,
 he comes to restraint in the future.

 Herein, Bhaddāli,
 some monk is not one that carries out[14] in full the Teacher's instruction.

 It occurs to him:
 'Suppose I were to resort to a remote lodging  to a forest,
 to the root of a tree,
 a mountain slope,
 a wild place,
 a hill cave,
 a cemetery,
 a woodland thicket,
 the open air,
 a heap of straw  I should probably realise conditions of further-men,
 the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.'

 So he resorts to a remote lodging  to a forest,
 to the root of a tree,
 a mountain slope,
 a wild place,
 a hill cave,
 a cemetery,
 a woodland thicket,
 the open air,
 a heap of straw.

 As he is staying aloof in this way
 the Teacher upbraids him,
 and when they have examined him
 his learned fellow Brahma-farers upbraid him,
 and devatās upbraid him,
 and the self upbraids the self.

 He, upbraided by the Teacher,
 and upbraided by his learned fellow Brahina-farers
 after they have examined him,
 and upbraided by devatās,
 and the self upbraided by the self,
 does not realise conditions of further-men,
 the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.

 What is [112] the reason for this?

 It is thus, Bhaddāli,
 since he is not one that carries out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction.[15]

 But, Bhaddāli, there is some monk here
 who fully carries out the training
 under the Teacher's instruction.

 It occurs to him:

 'If I were to resort to a remote lodging  to a forest,
 to the root of a tree,
 a mountain slope,
 a wild place,
 a hill cave,
 a cemetery,
 a woodland thicket,
 the open air,
 a heap of straw,
 I should probably realise conditions of further-men,
 the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.'

 So he resorts to a remote lodging  to a forest,
 to the root of a tree,
 a mountain slope,
 a wild place,
 a hill cave,
 a cemetery,
 a woodland thicket,
 the open air,
 a heap of straw.

 As he is staying aloof in this way
 neither the Teacher upbraids him,
 nor, after they have examined him,
 do his learned fellow Brahma-farers upbraid him,
 nor do devotās upbraid him,
 nor does the self upbraid the self.

 He, neither upbraided by the Teacher,
 nor upbraided by his learned fellow Brahma-farers
 after they have examined him,
 nor upbraided by devatās,
 nor the self upbraided by the self,
 realises conditions of further-men,
 the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.

 He, aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 enters and abides in the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is thus, Bhaddāli,
 for one who fully carries out the training
 under the Teacher's instruction.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by allaying initial and discursive thought,
 his mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is thus, Bhaddāli,
 for one who fully carries out the training
 under the Teacher's instruction.

 And again, monks, a monk,
 by the fading out of rapture,
 dwells with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and experiences in his person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and he enters on
 and abides in
 the third meditation.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is thus, Bhaddāli,
 for one who fully carries out the training
 under the Teacher's instruction.

 And again, monks, a monk
 by getting rid of joy,
 by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,
 enters on
 and abides in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish [113] nor joy,
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is thus, Bhaddāli,
 for one who fully carries out the training
 under the Teacher's instruction.

 Thus with the mind thus composed,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,[16]
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations.

 He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus:

 One birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration:

 'Such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where I was such a one by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so I was nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.'

 Thus he recollects divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail.

 ■

 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge of the passing hence
 and the arising of beings.

 With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 he sees beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of deeds,
 and thinks:

 'Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.'

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 does he see beings as they pass hence,
 as they arise;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of deeds.

 ■

 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 stable,
 immovable,
 he directs his mind
 to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.

 He comprehends as it really is:

 'This is anguish',
 'this is the arising of anguish',
 'this is the stopping of anguish',
 'this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish'.

 He comprehends as it really is:

 'These are the cankers',
 'this is the arising of the cankers',
 'this is the stopping of the cankers',
 'this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers'.

 Knowing thus,
 seeing thus,
 his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures
 and his mind is freed from the canker of becoming
 and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance.

 In freedom the knowledge comes to be:

 'I am freed';
 and he comprehends:

 'Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.'

 What is the reason for this?

 It is thus, Bhaddāli,
 for one who fully carries out the training
 under the Teacher's instruction."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:

 "What is the cause, revered sir,
 what the reason
 why they constantly[17] take action[18]
 against some monk here?

 What is the [114] cause, revered sir,
 what the reason
 why they do not constantly take similar action
 against some other monk here?"

 "As to this, Bhaddāli,
 some monk is a constant offender,
 full of offences.[19]

 On being spoken to by the monks
 he shelves the question
 by asking another,
 he answers off the point,
 he evinces anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,[20]
 he does not conduct himself properly,
 is not subdued,
 does not mend his ways,[21]
 and does not say:

 'What can I do to please the Order?'

 Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks:

 'This monk, your reverences,
 is a constant offender,
 full of offences.

 On being spoken to by the monks
 he shelves the question
 by asking another,
 he answers off the point,
 he evinces anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,
 he does not conduct himself properly,
 is not subdued,
 does not mend his ways,
 and does not say:

 'What can I do to please the Order?'

 It were good if the venerable ones
 were to investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 should not be settled quickly.'

 So, Bhaddāli,
 the monks investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 is not settled quickly.

 ■

 But, Bhaddāli,
 some monk is a constant offender,
 full of offences.

 He, on being spoken to by the monks
 does not shelve the question
 by asking another,
 he does not answer off the point,
 he does not evince anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,
 he conducts himself properly,
 is subdued,
 mends his ways,
 and he says:

 'What can I do to please the Order?

 Therefore, Bhaddāli,
 it occurs to the monks:

 'This monk, your reverences, is a constant offender,
 full of offences.

 He, on being spoken to by the monks
 does not shelve the question
 by asking another,
 he does not answer off the point,
 he does not evince anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,
 he conducts himself properly,
 is subdued,
 mends his ways,
 and he says:

 'What can I do to please the Order?

 It were good if the venerable ones were to investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 should be settled quickly.'

 So, Bhaddāli,
 the monte investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 is settled quickly.

 ■
 Then, Bhaddāli, some monk here is an occasional offender,
 he is not full of offences.

 But he, on being spoken to by the monks
 shelves the question
 by asking another,
 he answers off the point,
 he evinces anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,
 he does not conduct himself properly,
 is not subdued,
 does not mend his ways,
 and does not say:

 'What can I do to please the Order?'

 Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks:

 This monk, your reverences, is an occasional offender,
 he is not full of offences.

 But he, on being spoken to by the monks
 shelves the question
 by asking another,
 he answers off the point,
 he evinces anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,
 he does not conduct himself properly,
 is not subdued,
 does not mend his ways,
 and does not say:

 'What can [115] I do to please the Order?'
 It were good if the venerable ones
 were to investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 should not be settled quickly.'

 So, Bhaddāli,
 the monks investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 is not settled quickly.

 ■

 But, Bhaddāli, some monk is an occasional offender,
 he is not full of offences.

 He, on being spoken to by the monks
 does not shelve the question
 by asking another,
 he does not answer off the point,
 he does not evince anger
 and ill-will
 and discontent,
 he conducts himself properly,
 is subdued,
 mends his ways,
 and he says:

 'What can I do to please the Order?

 Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks:

 This monk, your reverences,
 is an occasional offender,
 he is not full of offences.
 He, on being spoken to by the monks
 does not shelve the question
 by asking another,
 he does not answer off the point,
 he does not evince anger
 and ill-will

 he conducts himself properly,
 is subdued,
 mends his ways,
 and he says:

 'What can I do to please the Order?

 It were good if the venerable ones were to investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 should be settled quickly.'

 So, Bhaddāli,
 the monte investigate this monk
 in such a way
 that this legal question of his
 is settled quickly.

 ■

 In this connection, Bhaddāli,
 some monk is going along
 with only a little faith,
 with only a little regard.[22]

 Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks:

 'This reverend monk
 is going along with only a little faith,
 only a little regard.
 If we constantly take action against this monk,
 be careful lest even that little faith of his,
 even that little regard,
 deteriorate.'

 Bhaddāli, it is like a man with only one eye[23]  his friends and acquaintances,
 his kith and kin
 would take care of that one eye
 so that that one eye of his
 did not deteriorate,
 thinking:

 'Take care lest that one eye of his deteriorates.'

 Even so, Bhaddāli,
 some monk goes along
 with only a little faith,
 only a little regard.

 Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks:

 'This reverend monk
 is going along with only a little faith,
 only a little regard.

 If we constantly take action against this monk,
 be careful lest even that little faith of his,
 even that little regard,
 deteriorate.'

 This, Bhaddāli, is the cause,
 this the reason
 why they constantly take action against some monk here.

 But, Bhaddāli, this is the cause,
 this the reason
 why they do not constantly take similar action
 against some (other) monk here."

 "What is the cause, revered sir,
 what the reason
 why there were formerly fewer rules of training
 but more monks who were established in profound knowledge?

 And what is the cause, revered sir,
 what the reason
 why there are now more rules of training
 but fewer monks who are established in profound knowledge?"

 [116] "It is thus, Bhaddāli:

 When beings are deteriorating,
 when true dhamma is vanishing away,
 there are more rules of training
 and fewer monks established in profound knowledge.

 Not until some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order[24]
 does the Teacher, Bhaddāli,
 lay down a rule of training for disciples.[24]

 But when, Bhaddāli,
 some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order,
 then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples
 so as to ward off
 those very conditions which cause cankers.

 Not until the Order has arrived at greatness,[25] Bhaddāli,
 do some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order.

 But when, Bhaddāli,
 the Order has arrived at greatness,
 then some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order,
 and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples
 so as to ward off
 those very conditions which cause cankers.

 ■

 Not until the Order has arrived at the height of gain,[26] Bhaddāli,
 do some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order.

 But when, Bhaddāli,
 the Order has arrived at the height of gain,
 then some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order,
 and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples
 so as to ward off
 those very conditions which cause cankers.

 ■

 Not until the Order has arrived at the height of fame,[27] Bhaddāli,
 do some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order.

 But when, Bhaddāli,
 the Order has arrived at the height of fame,
 then some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order,
 and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples
 so as to ward off
 those very conditions which cause cankers.

 ■

 Not until the Order has arrived at much learning,[28] Bhaddāli,
 do some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order.

 But when, Bhaddāli,
 the Order has arrived at much learning,
 then some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order,
 and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples
 so as to ward off
 those very conditions which cause cankers.

 ■

 Not until the Order has arrived at long standing,[29] Bhaddāli,
 do some conditions which [117] cause cankers
 appear here in the Order.

 But when, Bhaddāli,
 the Order has arrived at long standing,
 then some conditions which cause cankers
 appear here in the Order,
 and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples
 so as to ward off
 those very conditions which cause cankers.

 ■

 You were few at the time when I, Bhaddāli,
 taught you the disquisition on dhamma  the Parable of the Thoroughbred Colt.

 Do you, Bhaddāli, remember?"

 "No, revered sir."

 "To what cause
 do you attribute this, Bhaddāli?"
 "It is that I, revered sir,
 for a long time
 was not one who carried out in full
 the training under the Teacher's instruction."

 "This was not the only cause or reason, Bhaddāli.

 For, for a long time, Bhaddāli,
 I have known your mind
 with my mind
 (and I knew):

 While dhamma is being taught by me
 this foolish man does not listen to dhamma with ready ear,
 applying himself,
 paying attention,
 concentrating with all his mind.[30]

 However, I, Bhaddāli, will teach you
 the disquisition on dhamma  the Parable of the Thoroughbred Colt.

 Listen to it,
 attend carefully,
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the venerable Bhaddāli answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Bhaddāli, as a skilled horse-trainer,[31]
 having received a beautiful thoroughbred,
 first of all makes it get used to the training
 in respect of wearing the bit;
 while it is getting used to the training
 in respect of wearing the bit,
 whatever the contortions,
 capers,
 struggles[32]
 while it is getting used to a training
 it was not used to before,
 yet because of the continual training,
 the gradual training
 it is brought to perfection[33] in that respect.

 ■

 When, Bhaddāli, the beautiful thoroughbred [118] is perfected[34] in that respect
 by the continual training,
 the gradual training,
 the horse-trainer makes it get used to a further training
 in respect of wearing the harness.

 While it is getting used to the training
 in respect of wearing the harness,
 whatever the contortions,
 capers,
 struggles
 while it is getting used to a training
 it was not used to before,
 yet because of the continual training,
 the gradual training
 it is brought to perfection in that respect.

 ■

 When, Bhaddāli, the beautiful thoroughbred is perfected in that respect
 by the continual training,
 the gradual training,
 the horse-trainer makes it get used to a further training
 in respect of going straight on[35].
 While it is getting used to the training
 in respect of going straight on,
 whatever the contortions,
 capers,

 Bhaddāli, a beautiful thoroughbred,
 when endowed with these ten qualities,[42]
 becomes worthy of a king,
 a royal treasure,
 and it is reckoned as an attribute of royalty.

 Even so, Bhaddāli,
 if a monk is endowed with ten qualities,
 he is worthy of offerings,
 worthy of hospitality,
 worthy of gifts,
 to be saluted with joined palms,
 an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

 With what ten?

 Herein, Bhaddāli, a monk is endowed with an adept's right view,
 he is endowed with an adept's right thought,
 he is endowed with an adept's [119] right speech,
 he is endowed with an adept's right action,
 he is endowed with an adept's right mode of livelihood,
 he is endowed with an adept's right endeavour,
 he is endowed with an adept's right mindfulness,
 he is endowed with an adept's right concentration,
 he is endowed with an adept's right knowledge,
 he is endowed with an adept's right freedom.
 Bhaddāli, if a monk is endowed with these ten qualities,
 he is worthy of offerings,
 worthy of hospitality,
 worthy of gifts,
 to be saluted with joined palms,
 an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Bhaddāli rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
