# 144. Discourse on an Exhortation to Channa

## Chann'ovāda Sutta

#### Thus have I heard:

 At one time[1] the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove,
 at the Squirrels' Feeding-place.

 Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta
 and the venerable Cunda, the Great
 and the venerable Channa
 were staying on Mount Vulture Peak.

 At that time the venerable Channa was a sick man,
 in pain,
 grievously ill.

 And the venerable Sāriputta,
 emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,
 approached the venerable Cunda the Great;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to the venerable Cunda the Great:

 "Let us go on, reverend Cunda,
 and approach the venerable Channa
 so as to ask about his illness."[2]

 "Yes, reverend sir,"
 the venerable Cunda the Great answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 Then the venerable Sāriputta
 and the venerable Cunda the Great
 approached the venerable Channa;
 having approached,
 they exchanged greetings with the venerable Channa;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus
 to the venerable Channa:

 "I hope that you, reverend Channa,
 are getting better,
 I hope you are keeping going,
 I hope the painful feelings are lessening,
 not increasing,
 that a lessening in them is apparent,
 not an increase?"

 [316] "I am not getting better, reverend Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going;
 my grievously painful feelings[3] are increasing,
 not lessening,
 an increasing in them is apparent,
 not a lessening.

 I will take a knife (to myself),
 I do not desire life."[4]

 "Do not let the venerable Channa
 take a knife (to himself).

 The venerable Channa must go on living.

 We want the venerable Channa to go on living.

 If the venerable Channa has no beneficial foods,
 I will search for beneficial foods
 for the venerable Channa.

 If the venerable Channa has no beneficial medicines,
 I will search for beneficial medicines
 for the venerable Channa.

 If the venerable Channa has no suitable attendant,
 I will attend to the venerable Channa.

 Do not let the venerable Channa take a knife (to himself).

 The venerable Channa must go on living.

 We want the venerable Channa to go on living."

 "Reverend Sāriputta,
 I am not without beneficial foods,
 I am not without beneficial medicines,
 nor am I without a suitable attendant.

 Moreover, reverend Sāriputta,
 for a long time have I waited on[5] the Teacher
 with satisfaction[6] (to him),
 not with lack of satisfaction[6] (to him).

 For this, reverend Sāriputta, is suitable in a disciple,
 that he should wait on the Teacher
 with satisfaction (to him),
 not with lack of satisfaction (to him).

 'Channa the monk will take a knife (to himself)
 without incurring blame'[7]
 remember this thus, reverend Sāriputta."

 "We would question the venerable Channa
 on a particular matter
 if the venerable Channa grants us the opportunity
 for setting forth the question."[8]

 "Ask, reverend Sāriputta;
 having heard (you)
 we will know (what to say)."

 [317] "Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye,
 visual consciousness,
 the things cognisable by visual consciousness as
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?

 ■
 Do you regard the ear,
 auditory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by auditory consciousness as
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?

 ■

 Do you regard the nose,
 olfactory consciousness,

 this am I,
 this is my self'?

 ■
 Do you regard the mind,

 the things cognisable by mental consciousness as
 'This is mine,
 this am I,
 this is my self'?

 "Reverend Sāriputta, I regard the eye,
 visual consciousness,
 the things cognisable by visual consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 ■

 I regard the ear,
 auditory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by auditory consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 this is not my self'.

 ■

 I regard the mind,
 mental consciousness,
 the things cognisable by mental consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 "Reverend Channa, what do you see,
 what do you understand there is in the eye,
 in visual consciousness,
 in the things cognisable by visual consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'?

 ■

 What do you see,
 what do you understand there is in the ear,
 auditory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by auditory consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'?

 ■

 What do you see,

 What do you see,
 what do you understand there is in the tongue,
 gustatory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by gustatory consciousness as
 'This is not mine,

 ■

 What do you see,
 what do you understand there is in the body,
 tactile consciousness,
 the things cognisable by tactile consciousness as
 'This is not mine,

 ■

 What do you see,
 what do you understand there is in the mind,
 mental consciousness,
 the things cognisable by mental consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'?

 "It is because I see cessation,[8]
 understand that there is cessation
 in the eye, reverend Sāriputta,
 in visual consciousness,
 in the things cognisable by visual consciousness||
 that I, reverend Sāriputta, regard
 the eye,
 visual consciousness,
 the things cognisable by visual consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 ■
 It is because I see cessation,
 understand that there is cessation
 in the ear,
 auditory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by auditory consciousness||
 that I regard
 the ear,
 auditory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by auditory consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 ■

 It is because I see cessation,
 understand that there is cessation
 in the nose,
 olfactory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by olfactory consciousness||
 that I regard
 the nose,
 olfactory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by olfactory consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 ■

 It is because I see cessation,
 understand that there is cessation
 in the tongue,
 gustatory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by gustatory consciousness||
 that I regard
 the tongue,
 gustatory consciousness,
 the things cognisable by gustatory consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'.

 ■

 It is because I see cessation,
 understand that there is cessation

 mental consciousness,
 the things cognisable by mental consciousness||
 that I regard
 the mind,
 mental consciousness,
 the things cognisable by mental consciousness as
 'This is not mine,
 this am I not,
 this is not my self'."
 When this had been said,
 the venerable Cunda the Great spoke thus
 to the venerable Channa:[10]

 "Wherefore, reverend Channa,
 this teaching of the Lord
 should always be attended to:

 'For[11] him who clings there is wavering;
 for him who clings not there is no wavering;
 if there is no wavering [318] there is impassibility;[12]
 if there is impassibility there is no yearning;[13]
 if there is no yearning,[14] there is no coming and going;[15]
 if there is no coming and going, there is no deceasing and uprising;
 if there is no deceasing and uprising,
 there is no "here" itself
 nor "yonder"
 nor "in between the two."
 This is itself the end of anguish.'

 Then the venerable Sāriputta
 and the venerable Cunda the Great,
 having exhorted the venerable Channa
 with this exhortation,
 rose from their seats and departed.

 And not long after the departure of the venerable Sāriputta
 and the venerable Cunda the Great,
 the venerable Channa took a knife (to himself).[16]
 Then the venerable Sāriputta approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, a knife has been taken
 by the venerable Channa to himself.

 What is his bourn,
 what his future state?"

 "Was it not face to face with you, Sāriputta,
 that the monk Channa declared (his) blamelessness?"[17]

 "There is, revered sir, a village of the Vajjis called Pubbajira.[18]

 There are families there
 who were friends of the venerable Channa,
 families which sustained[19] him,
 families to be visited."[20]

 "Indeed, Sāriputta,
 these families were friends of the monk Channa,
 families who sustained him,
 families to be visited.

 As far as this, Sāriputta,
 I do not say he was to be blamed.[21]

 But whoever, [319] Sāriputta,
 lays down this body
 and grasps after another body,
 of him I say he is to be blamed.[22]
 The monk Channa did not do this;[23]
 the monk Channa took the knife (to himself) without incurring blame."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Sāriputta
 rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
