# 96. Discourse with Esukārī

## Phasukārī or Esukārī Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then the brahman Esukārī approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Esukārī the brahman spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Brahmans, good Gotama,
 lay down four (types of) service:
 they lay down service for a brahman,
 they lay down service for a noble,
 they lay down service for a merchant,
 they lay down service for a worker.

 As to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down service for a brahman,
 saying:

 'A brahman may serve a brahman,
 or a noble may serve a brahman,
 or a merchant may serve a brahman,
 or a worker may serve a brahman.'

 This is the service, good Gotama,
 that brahmans lay down for a brahman.

 As to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down service for a noble,
 saying:|| ||

 'A noble may serve a noble
 or a merchant may serve a noble
 or a worker may serve a noble.'

 This is the service, good Gotama,
 that brahmans lay down for a noble.

 As to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down service for a merchant,
 saying:

 'A merchant may serve a merchant
 or a worker may serve a merchant.'

 This is the service, good Gotama,
 that brahmans lay down for a merchant.
 As to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down service for a worker,
 saying:

 'A worker may serve a worker.

 For who else could serve a worker?'

 This is the [367] service, good Gotama,
 that brahmans lay down for a worker.

 Brahmans, good Gotama,
 lay down these four (types of) service.

 What does the good Gotama say about this?"

 "But, brahman, does everyone agree with the brahmans
 when they lay down these four (types of) service?"

 "No, good Gotama."

 "Like a poor
 needy
 destitute man[1]
 on whom they might force a morsel
 (of meat although)
 he did not want it,
 saying:

 'You must eat this meat, my good man,
 and you must hand over a price for it as well'
 even so, brahman,
 do the brahmans  and moreover
 without the assent of recluses and brahmans  lay down these four (types of) service.
 I, brahman, do not say
 that everyone should serve.

 But, brahman, I do not say
 that everyone should not serve.

 For if, brahman,
 there is a servitor
 who is worse for his service,
 not better,
 I do not say that he should serve.

 But if, brahman, there is a servitor
 who is better for his service,
 not worse,
 I say that he should serve.

 And if, brahman, one should ask a noble,
 saying:

 'Is your servitor worse,
 not better,
 as a result of his service;
 or is your servitor, better,
 not worse,
 as a result of his service?

 And so which one should you be served by?'

 - then the noble, brahman,
 in replying rightly
 would reply thus:
 'The servitor who is worse,
 not better,
 as a result of serving me  I should not be served by him.

 But the servitor who is better,
 not worse,
 as a result of serving me  I should be served by him.'

 ■

 And if, brahman, one should ask a brahman,
 saying:

 'Is your servitor worse,
 not better,
 as a result of his service;
 or is your servitor, better,
 not worse,
 as a result of his service?

 And so which one should you be served by?'

 - then the brahman, brahman,
 in replying rightly
 would reply thus:

 'The servitor who is worse,
 not better,
 as a result of serving me  I should not be served by him.

 But the servitor who is better,
 not worse,
 as a result of serving me  I should be served by him.'
 ■

 And if, brahman, one should ask a merchant,
 saying:

 'Is your servitor worse,
 not better,
 as a result of his service;
 or is your servitor, better,
 not worse,
 as a result of his service?

 And so which one should you be served by?'

 - then the merchant, brahman,
 in replying rightly
 would reply thus:

 'The servitor who is worse,
 not better,
 as a result of serving me  I should not be served by him.

 But the servitor who is better,
 not worse,
 as a result of serving me  I should be served by him.'

 ■

 And if, brahman, one should ask a worker,
 saying:

 'Is your servitor worse,
 not better,
 as a result of his service;
 or is your servitor, better,
 not worse,
 as a result of his service?

 And so which one should you be served by?'

 - then the worker, brahman,
 in replying rightly
 would reply thus:

 'The servitor who is worse,
 not better,
 as a result of serving me  I should not be served by him.

 But the servitor who is better,
 not worse,
 as a result of serving me  I should be served by him.'

 I, brahman, do not speak of 'better'
 because of birth in a high-class family.[2]

 But, brahman, I do not speak of 'worse'
 because of birth in a high-class family.

 I, brahman, do not speak of 'better'
 because of splendour of complexion.[3]

 But, brahman, I do not speak of 'worse'
 because of splendour of complexion.
 I, brahman, do not speak of 'better'
 because of splendour of possessions,[4]

 But I, brahman, do not speak of 'worse'
 because of splendour of possessions.

 ■

 For, as to this, brahman,
 someone from a high-class [368] family
 makes onslaught on creatures,
 takes what has not been given,
 wrongly enjoys pleasures of the senses,
 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 of wrong view.

 Therefore I do not speak of 'better'
 because of birth in a high-class family.

 But, as to this, brahman,
 someone from a high-class family
 may refrain from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from wrongly enjoying pleasures of the senses,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 from harsh speech,
 from gossiping,
 and be not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind,
 of right view.
 Therefore I do speak of 'worse'
 because of birth in a high-class family.

 ■

 For, as to this, brahman,
 someone with splendour of complexion
 makes onslaught on creatures,
 takes what has not been given,
 wrongly enjoys pleasures of the senses,
 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,
 malevolent in mind,
 of wrong view.

 Therefore I do not speak of 'better'
 because of splendour of complexion.

 But, as to this, brahman,
 someone with splendour of complexion
 may refrain from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from wrongly enjoying pleasures of the senses,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 from harsh speech,
 from gossiping,
 and be not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind,
 of right view.

 Therefore I do speak of 'worse'
 because of splendour of complexion.
 ■

 someone with splendour of possessions

 takes what has not been given,
 wrongly enjoys pleasures of the senses,
 is a liar,
 of slanderous speech,
 of harsh speech,
 a gossip,
 covetous,

 Therefore I do not speak of 'better'

 But, as to this, brahman,
 someone with splendour of possessions
 may refrain from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from wrongly enjoying pleasures of the senses,
 from lying,
 from slanderous speech,
 from harsh speech,
 from gossiping,
 and be not covetous,

 Therefore I do speak of 'worse'
 because of splendour of possessions.

 I, brahman, do not say that everyone should serve.

 But, brahman, I do not say that everyone should not serve.
 That servitor, brahman,
 in whom as a result of his service
 faith grows,
 moral habit grows,
 learning grows,
 renunciation grows,
 wisdom grows,[5]
 I say of him that he should serve."

 When this had been said, Esukārī the brahman
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Brahmans, good Gotama,
 lay down four (types of) treasure:[6]
 they lay down a brahman's wealth,[7]
 they lay down a noble's wealth,
 they lay down a merchant's wealth,
 they lay down a worker's wealth.

 In regard to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down that a brahman's wealth
 is walking for alms.[8]

 But, on despising the wealth
 of walking for alms,
 a brahman is one
 who does not meet his obligations
 and is like a guardian
 taking what has not been given.
 This, good Gotama, is how brahmans
 lay down a brahman's wealth.

 ■

 In regard to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down that a noble's wealth
 is the bow and quiver.

 But, on despising the wealth of bow and quiver,
 a noble is one
 who does not meet his obligations
 and is like a guardian
 taking what has not been given.

 This, good Gotama, is how brah- [369] mans
 lay down a noble's wealth.

 ■

 In regard to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down
 that a merchant's[9] wealth
 is agriculture and cow-keeping.[10]

 But, on despising the wealth of agriculture and cow-keeping,
 a merchant is one
 who does not meet his obligations
 and is like a guardian
 taking what has not been given.

 This, good Gotama, is how brahmans
 lay down a merchant's wealth.

 ■
 In regard to this, good Gotama,
 brahmans lay down
 that a worker's wealth is the sickle and pingo.

 But, on despising the wealth of sickle and pingo,
 a worker is one
 who does not meet his obligations
 and is like a guardian
 taking what has not been given.

 This, good Gotama, is how brahmans
 lay down a worker's wealth.

 Brahmans, good Gotama,
 lay down these four (types of) treasure.

 What does the good Gotama say about this?"

 "But, brahman, does everyone agree with the brahmans
 when they lay down these four (types of) treasure?"

 "No, good Gotama."

 "Like a poor
 needy
 destitute man
 on whom they might force a morsel
 (of meat although)
 he did not want it,
 saying:

 'You must eat this meat, my good man,
 and you must hand over a price for it as well'
 even so, brahman,
 do the brahmans  and moreover
 without the assent of recluses and brahmans  lay down these four (types of) treasure.

 Now I, brahman, lay down
 that a man's wealth is dhamma,
 ariyan,
 supermundane.

 On recollecting his ancient family lineage
 on his maternal and paternal sides,[10]
 wherever it is
 that there is the production of an individuality,[11]
 it is reckoned in accordance with that.

 So, if there is the production of an individuality
 in a noble family,
 it is reckoned as a noble.

 If there is the production of an individuality
 in a brahman family,
 it is reckoned as a brahman.

 If there is the production of an individuality
 in a merchant family,
 it is reckoned as a merchant.

 If there is the production of an individuality
 in a worker family,
 it is reckoned as a worker.

 ■
 As a fire, brahman,
 no matter on account of what condition it burns,
 is reckoned precisely as that:

 if the fire burns
 because of dry sticks
 it is reckoned as a dry stick fire;
 if the fire burns because of chips
 it is reckoned as a fire of chips;
 if the fire burns
 because of grass
 it is reckoned as a grass fire;
 if the fire burns
 because of cowdung
 it is reckoned as a cowdung fire
 -even so, brahman,
 do I lay down that a man's wealth is dhamma,
 ariyan,
 supermundane.

 ■

 On recollecting his ancient family lineage
 on his maternal and paternal sides,
 wherever it is that there is the production of an individuality,
 it is reckoned in accordance with that.

 So, if there is the production of an individuality
 in a noble family,

 [370]it is reckoned precisely as a noble.

 If there is the production of an individuality
 in a brahman family,
 it is reckoned precisely as a brahman.

 If there is the production of an individuality
 in a merchant family,
 it is reckoned precisely as a merchant.

 If there is the production of an individuality
 in a worker family,
 it is reckoned precisely as a worker.

 But if, brahman,
 one who has gone forth from home
 into homelessness
 from a noble family,
 owing to the dhamma and discipline
 promulgated by the Tathāgata
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from unchastity,
 lying,
 slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossiping,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind
 and is of right view,
 he is accomplishing the right path,
 dhamma,
 what is skilled.[12]

 ■

 And if, brahman,
 one who has gone forth from home
 into homelessness
 from a brahman family,
 owing to the dhamma and discipline
 promulgated by the Tathāgata
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from unchastity,
 lying,
 slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossiping,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind
 and is of right view,
 he is accomplishing the right path,
 dhamma,
 what is skilled.

 And if, brahman,

 lying,
 slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossiping,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind
 and is of right view,
 he is accomplishing the right path,
 dhamma,
 what is skilled.

 ■

 And if, brahman,
 one who has gone forth from home
 into homelessness
 from a worker family,
 owing to the dhamma and discipline
 promulgated by the Tathāgata
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from unchastity,
 lying,
 slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossiping,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind
 and is of right view,
 he is accomplishing the right path,
 dhamma,
 what is skilled.

 What do you think about this, brahman?

 On this supposition,
 is it only a brahman
 who is capable of developing a mind of friendliness
 that is without enmity,
 without malevolence?
 And not a noble,
 not a merchant,
 not a worker?"[13]

 "That is not so, good Gotama.

 For on this supposition
 a noble too
 is capable of developing a mind of friendliness
 that is without enmity,
 without malevolence,
 and so is a brahman, good Gotama,
 and so is a merchant, good Gotama,
 and so is a worker, good Gotama  so, good Gotama,
 on this supposition
 all the four castes
 are capable of developing a mind of friendliness
 that is without enmity,
 without malevolence."

 "Even so, brahman, if
 one who has gone forth from home
 into homelessness
 from a noble family,
 owing to the dhamma and discipline
 promulgated by the Tathāgata
 refrains from onslaught on creatures,
 from taking what has not been given,
 from unchastity,
 lying,
 slanderous speech,
 harsh speech,
 gossiping,
 is not covetous,
 not malevolent in mind
 and is of right view,
 he is accomplishing the right path,
 dhamma,
 what is skilled.

 What do you think about this, brahman?

 Is it only a brahman
 who, taking a back-scratcher and bath-powder[14]
 and going to a river,
 is capable of cleansing himself of dust and mud?

 And not a noble,
 not a merchant,
 not a worker?"

 "That is not so, good Gotama.

 A noble too, good Gotama, [371] taking a back-scratcher and bath-powder
 and going to a river,
 is capable of cleansing himself of dust and mud.

 And so is a brahman, good Gotama,
 and so is a merchant, good Gotama,
 and so is a worker, good Gotama  so, good Gotama,
 all the four castes,
 taking a back-scratcher and bath-powder
 and going to a river,
 are capable of cleansing themselves of dust and mud."

 "Even so, brahman, if
 one who has gone forth from home
 into homelessness

 What do you think about this, brahman?

 If[15] a noble anointed king
 were to assemble a hundred men of varying origins
 saying to them:

 'Let the good sirs come;
 and let those who are of noble,
 priestly
 and royal families,
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick
 of teak
 or sāl
 or of a sweet-scented tree
 or of sandal
 or lotus,
 light a fire
 and get it to give out heat.

 But let the good sirs come;
 and let those who are from a despised family,
 a trapper family,
 a bamboo-plaiter family,
 a cartwright family,
 a scavenger family,
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick
 from a dog's trough
 or a pig's trough
 or from a trough for dyeing
 or dry sticks from castor-oil shrub,
 light a fire
 and get it to give out heat.'

 What do you think about this, brahman?

 Is the fire that is lit
 and the heat that is got by someone  no matter whether he be from a noble,
 priestly
 or royal family,
 and no matter whether he bring an upper piece of fire-stick
 of teak
 or sāl
 or of a sweet-scented tree
 or of sandal
 or lotus  is it a fire
 that has flame
 and hue
 and brightness
 and, being this fire,
 is it able to serve the purposes of a fire?

 But is the fire that is lit
 and the heat that is got by someone  no matter whether he be from a despised family,
 a trapper family,
 a bamboo-plaiter family,
 a cartwright family,
 a scavenger family,
 and no matter whether he bring an upper piece of fire-stick
 from a dog's trough
 or a pig's trough
 or from a trough for dyeing
 or dry sticks from a castor-oil shrub  is it a fire
 that has neither flame
 nor hue
 nor brightness
 and, being this fire,
 is it unable to serve the purposes of a fire?"

 "That is not so, good Gotama.

 Whoever from a noble,
 priestly
 or royal family,
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick
 of teak
 or sāl
 or of a sweet-scented tree
 or of sandal
 or lotus,
 lights a fire
 and gets it to give out heat  this fire has flame
 and hue
 and brightness
 and is able to serve the purposes of a fire.

 And too,
 whoever from a despised family,
 a trapper family,
 a bamboo-plaiter family,
 a cartwright family,
 a scavenger family,
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick
 from a dog's trough
 or a pig's trough
 or a trough for dyeing
 or dry sticks from a castor-oil shrub,
 lights a fire
 and gets it to give out heat  this fire too
 has flame
 and hue
 and brightness
 and is able to serve the purposes of a fire.

 So, good Gotama,
 all these fires
 have flame
 and hue
 and brightness
 and are able to serve the purposes of a fire."

 When this had been said
 the brahman Esukārī spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is excellent, good Gotama,
 excellent, good Gotama.

 It is as if, good Gotama,
 one might set upright what had been upset,
 or might disclose what was covered,
 or point out the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so is dhamma made clear
 in many a figure by the good Gotama.

 I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the revered Gotama accept me
 as a lay-follower,
 one gone for refuge from today forth
 for as long as life lasts."
