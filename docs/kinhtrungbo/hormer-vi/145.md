# 145. Discourse on an Exhortation to Puṇṇa

## Puṇṇ'ovāda Sutta

#### Thus have I heard:

 At one time[1] the Lord was once staying near Sāvatthī,
 in the Jeta Grove,
 in Anāthapiṇḍika's, monastery.

 Then the venerable Puṇṇa,[2]
 emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Puṇṇa spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It would be good, revered sir,
 if the Lord would exhort me
 with an exhortation in brief
 so that I,
 having heard dhamma from the Lord,
 might abide alone,
 aloof,
 diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute."

 "Well then, Puṇṇa, listen,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the venerable Puṇṇa answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "There are, Puṇṇa,
 material shapes cognisable by the eye,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 If a monk delights in these,[3]
 welcomes them
 and persists in cleaving to them,
 then, because he delights in them,
 welcomes them
 and persists in cleaving to them,
 delight uprises in him.
 I say, [320] Puṇṇa,
 that from the uprising of delight
 is the uprising of anguish.

 "There are, Puṇṇa,
 sounds cognisable by the ear,
 agreeable,
 pleasant,
 liked,
 enticing,
 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 If a monk delights in these,
 welcomes them
 and persists in cleaving to them,
 then, because he delights in them,

 that from the uprising of delight
 is the uprising of anguish.

 "There are, Puṇṇa,

 "There are, Puṇṇa,

 connected with sensual pleasures,
 alluring.

 If a monk does not delight in these,
 does not welcome them
 or persists in cleaving to them,
 then, because he does not delight in them,
 welcomes them
 or persists in cleaving to them,
 delight is stopped in him.

 I say, Puṇṇa,
 that from the stopping of delight
 is the stopping of anguish.

 And in what district will you stay, Puṇṇa,
 now that you have been exhorted by me
 with this exhortation in brief?"

 "There is a district called Sunāparanta.[4]

 I will stay there, revered sir,
 now that I have been exhorted by the Lord
 with this exhortation in brief."

 "Puṇṇa, the people of Sunāparanta are fierce,
 the people of Sunāparanta are rough.

 If the people of Sunāparanta
 revile[5] and abuse you, Puṇṇa,
 how will it be for you there, Puṇṇa?"

 "If the people of Sunāparanta
 revile and abuse me, revered sir,
 it will be thus for me there:

 I will say,

 'Goodly indeed are these people of Sunāparanta,
 indeed very goodly are these people of Sunāparanta
 in that they do not strike me a blow with their hands.'
 It will be thus for me here, Lord,
 it will be thus for me here, Well-farer."

 ■

 "But if the people of Sunāparnata
 do strike you a blow with their hands, Puṇṇa,
 how will it be for you there, Puṇṇa?"

 "If the people of Sunāparanta
 strike me a blow with their hands, revered sir,
 it will be thus for me there:

 I will say,

 'Goodly indeed are these people of Sunāparanta,
 indeed very goodly are these people [321] of Sunāparanta
 in that they do not strike me a blow with clods of earth.'

 It will be thus for me here, Lord,
 it will be thus for me here, Well-farer."

 ■

 "But if the people of Sunāparanta
 do strike you a blow with clods of earth, Puṇṇa,
 how will it be for you there, Puṇṇa?"

 "If the people of Sunāparanta
 strike me a blow with clods of earth, revered sir,
 it will be thus for me there:

 I will say,

 'Goodly indeed are these people of Sunāparanta,
 indeed very goodly are these people of Sunāparanta
 in that they do not strike me a blow with a stick.'[6]
 It will be thus for me here, Lord,
 it will be thus for me here, Well-farer."

 ■

 "But if the people of Sunāparanta
 do strike you a blow with a stick, Puṇṇa,
 how will it be for you there, Puṇṇa?"

 "If the people of Sunāparanta
 strike me a blow with a stick, revered sir,
 it will be thus for me there:

 I will say,

 'Goodly indeed are these people of Sunāparanta,
 indeed very goodly are these people of Sunāparanta
 in that they do not strike me a blow with a knife.'

 It will be thus for me here, Lord,
 it will be thus for me here, Well-farer."

 ■

 "But if the people of Sunāparanta
 do strike you a blow with a knife, Puṇṇa,
 how will it be for you there, Puṇṇa?"

 "If the people of Sunāparanta
 strike me a blow with a knife, revered sir,
 it will be thus for me there:

 I will say,

 'Goodly indeed are these people of Sunāparanta,
 indeed very goodly are these people of Sunāparanta
 in that they do not deprive me of life
 with a sharp knife.'

 It will be thus for me here, Lord,
 it will be thus for me here, Well-farer."

 ■

 "But if the people of Sunāparanta
 do deprive you of life
 with a sharp knife, Puṇṇa,
 how will it be for you there, Puṇṇa?"

 "If the people of Sunāparanta
 deprive me of life
 with a sharp knife, revered sir,
 it will be thus for me there:

 I will say,

 'There are disciples of the Lord
 who, disgusted by the body
 and the life-principle
 and ashamed of them,
 look about for a knife
 (with which to kill themselves).[7]
 I have come upon this very knife
 without having looked about for it.'

 It will be thus for me here, Lord,
 it will be thus for me here, Well-farer."

 "It is good, Puṇṇa,
 it is good.

 You will be able to live in the district
 among the people of Sunāparanta
 possessed as you are
 of this taming and calm.[8]

 You, Punna, now do that
 for which you deem the time is right."

 Then the venerable Puṇṇa,
 having rejoiced in what the Lord had said
 and having given thanks for it,
 rose from his seat
 and greeted the Lord
 keeping his right side towards him,
 packed away his lodging
 and, taking his bowl and robe,
 set out on tour for the Sunāparanta district.

 Walking on tour,
 he gradually arrived at the Sunāparanta district.

 While he was there
 the venerable Punṇa stayed in the district among the people of Sunāparanta.

 And [322] during the same rainy season
 the venerable Puṇṇa established as many as five hundred lay-devotees,
 as many as five hundred female lay-devotees,
 and he realised the three knowledges.

 Then after a time
 the venerable Puṇṇa attained final nibbāna.[9]

 A number of monks approached the Lord;
 having approached and greeted the Lord,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,
 these monks spoke thus to the Lord:
 "Revered sir, that young man of family[10] named Puṇṇa
 who was exhorted by the Lord with an exhortation in brief,
 has died.

 What is his bourn,
 what his future state?"

 "Clever, monks, was Puṇṇa
 the young man of family;
 he followed after dhamma
 according to the various parts of dhamma;
 and he did not annoy me
 with questionings about dhamma.

 Puṇṇa the young man of family
 has gained final nibbāna, monks."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
