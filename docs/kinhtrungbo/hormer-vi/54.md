# 54. Discourse to Potaliya

## Potaliya Sutta

#### [359] [25]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Aṅguttarāpa.[1]

 Āpaṇa[2] was a market town in Aṅguttarāpa.

 Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Āpaṇa for almsfood.

 When he had walked for almsfood in Āpaṇa
 and was returning from the alms-gathering after the meal,
 he approached a certain forest-thicket for the day-sojourn;
 and having plunged into that forest-thicket
 he sat down at the root of a tree.
 And the householder Potaliya,[3]
 who was constantly pacing up and down
 and roaming about on foot,
 fully dressed[4] and clothed,[4]
 with parasol and slippers,
 approached that forest-thicket;
 having plunged into that forest-thicket,
 he approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he stood at a respectful distance.

 Then the Lord spoke thus
 to the householder Potaliya
 as he was standing at a respectful distance:

 "There are seats, householder;
 if you wish,
 do sit down."

 When this had been said,
 the householder Potaliya
 thinking:

 "The recluse Gotama addresses me
 with the word 'householder'",
 angry,
 displeased,
 became silent.

 And a second time
 the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:

 "There are [26] seats, householder;
 if you wish,
 do sit down."

 And a second time
 the householder Potaliya
 thinking:

 "The recluse Gotama addresses me
 with the word 'householder'",
 angry,
 displeased,
 became silent.

 And a third time
 the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:

 "There are seats, householder;
 if you wish,
 do sit down."

 When this had been said,
 the householder Potaliya
 thinking:

 "The recluse Gotama addresses me
 with the word 'householder'",
 angry,
 displeased,
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "This,[360]good Gotama, is not proper,
 it is not suitable,
 that you should address me
 with the word 'householder.' "

 "But you, householder,
 have all the characteristic marks and signs
 of a householder."
 "But all relevant occupations
 have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,
 all avocations given up."

 "But, householder,
 how have all occupations been abandoned by you,
 all avocations given up?"

 "As to this, good Gotama,
 I handed over to my sons
 as their inheritance
 all that I had of wealth
 or grain
 or silver
 or gold.

 Without giving advice or blame in these matters
 I live on a minimum
 of food and covering.[5]

 This is how all occupations have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,
 all avocations given up."

 "But what you, householder, call
 a giving up of avocations
 is one thing;
 but in the discipline for an ariyan
 the giving up of avocations
 is another thing."

 "And what, revered sir,
 is the giving up of avocations
 in the discipline for an ariyan?

 It would be good, revered sir,
 if the Lord were to teach me dhamma
 as to that which is the giving up of avocations
 in the discipline for an ariyan."

 "Well then, householder, listen,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Householder, these eight things
 conduce to the giving up of avocations
 in the discipline for an ariyan.[6]

 What eight?

 Through no onslaught on creatures,
 onslaught on creatures should be got rid of;

 through taking what is given,
 taking what is not given should be got rid of;

 through speaking truth,
 lying speech should be got rid of;

 through unslanderous speech,
 slanderous speech should be got rid of;

 through non-covetise and greed,
 covetise and greed should be got rid of;

 through no angry fault-finding,
 angry fault-finding should be got [27] rid of;
 through no wrathful rage,
 wrathful rage should be got rid of;

 through no arrogance,
 arrogance should be got rid of.

 These are the eight things, householder,
 spoken of in brief,
 not explained in detail,
 that, in the discipline for an ariyan,
 conduce to the giving up of avocations."

 "As to these eight things, revered sir,
 which are spoken of in brief,
 not explained in detail,
 and which, in the discipline for an ariyan,
 conduce to the giving up of avocations,
 it were good, revered sir,
 if the Lord
 out of compassion
 were to explain these eight things to me in detail."

 "Well then, householder, listen,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 [361]"When I said:

 'Through no onslaught on creatures,
 onslaught on creatures should be got rid of'
 in reference to what was this said?
 As to this, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'I am faring along
 for getting rid of
 and abandoning
 those fetters of which
 onslaught on creatures might be a cause;
 for if I were to make onslaught on creatures,
 not only would self upbraid me
 as a result of making onslaught on creatures,
 but intelligent men (also)
 after scrutinising,
 would blame me[7]
 as a result of making onslaught on creatures;
 and at the breaking up of the body after dying
 a bad bourn would be expected
 as a result of making onslaught on creatures.

 This is indeed a fetter,
 this is a hindrance,
 that is to say onslaught on creatures.

 But for one who refrains
 from onslaught on creatures
 there are not those destructive and consuming cankers[8]
 that might arise as a result
 of making onslaught on creatures.'

 When I said:

 'Through no onslaught on creatures,
 onslaught on creatures should be got rid of,'

 it was said in reference to this."

 it was said in reference to this."

 [364]"These, householder, are the eight things spoken of in brief,
 (now) explained in detail,
 that, in the discipline for an ariyan,
 conduce to the giving up of a vocations.

 But not even yet
 in the [28] discipline for an ariyan
 is there an entire giving up in every way
 of all avocations."

 "But how is it, revered sir,
 in the discipline for an ariyan
 there is an entire giving up in every way
 of all avocations?

 It were good, revered sir,
 if the Lord were to teach me dhamma as to how,
 in the discipline for an ariyan,
 there is an entire giving up in every way
 of all avocations."

 "Well then, householder, listen,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."
 "Yes, revered sir,"
 the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "It is, householder,
 as if a dog,
 overcome by hunger and exhaustion[9]
 were to happen on a slaughtering place for cows,
 and the skilled cattle-butcher there
 or his apprentice
 were to fling him a bone,
 scraped
 and well scraped,
 fleshless,
 but with a smearing of blood.

 What do you think about this, householder?

 Could that dog,
 gnawing such a bone,
 scraped and well scraped,
 fleshless,
 but with a smearing of blood,
 appease his hunger and exhaustion?'

 "No, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 That bone, revered sir,
 is scraped and well scraped,
 fleshless,
 but although it has a smearing of blood,
 that dog would be worn out with fatigue
 or ever he got anything from it."
 "Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened to a skeleton[10] by the Lord,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'

 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided[11] that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,[12]
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 And, householder,
 it is as if a vulture
 or kite
 or hawk
 seizing a lump of flesh
 were to fly upwards,
 and other vultures,
 kites
 and hawks
 following hard after it
 were to tear at it
 and pull it to pieces.[13]

 What do you think about this, householder?
 If that vulture
 or kite
 or [29] hawk
 were not to let go quickly
 of that lump of flesh,
 would it, from that cause,
 come to death
 or pain like unto death?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened to a lump of flesh[14] by the Lord,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'

 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 And, householder,
 it is as though a man might come along
 bringing a blazing grass torch[15]
 against the wind.
 What do you think about this, householder?

 If that man were not to let go quickly
 of that blazing grass torch,
 would it burn his hand
 or burn his arm
 or burn another part of his body
 so that, from that cause,
 he would come to death
 or pain like unto death?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened by the Lord to a grass torch,[16],
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'

 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 And, householder,
 it is as if there might be a pit of glowing embers,
 deeper than a man's height,
 full of embers
 that were neither flaming nor smoking,[17]
 and a man might come along
 wanting to live,
 not wanting to die,
 wanting happiness,
 recoiling from pain;
 but two strong men,
 having grasped hold of his arms,
 might drag him towards
 that pit of glowing embers.

 What do you think about this, householder?

 Would not that man
 twist his body
 this way
 and that?"[18]

 "Yes, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 Revered sir, that man realises:

 'If I fall down
 into this pit of glowing embers,
 from that cause
 I will come to death
 or pain like unto death.'"

 "Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened by the Lord
 to a pit of glowing embers,[19],
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'

 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 [30] And, householder,
 it is as if a man might see in a dream
 delightful parks,
 delightful woods,
 delightful stretches of level ground
 and delightful lakes;
 but on waking up
 could see nothing.

 Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened by the Lord
 to a dream,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'
 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 And, householder,
 it is as if a man,
 having borrowed[20] a loan of wealth,

 [366]a fashionable[21] vehicle
 and splendid jewels and ear-ornaments,
 might go forth into the bazaar,
 honoured for his loan of wealth,
 surrounded by it,
 so that people having seen him
 might say:

 'This man is indeed wealthy,
 and undoubtedly wealthy men
 enjoy their wealth thus';

 but the veritable owners,
 wherever they might, see him,
 might take away what was theirs.

 What do you think about this, householder?

 Would that man have had enough
 of being other (than what he is)?"
 "Yes, revered sir.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is, revered sir,
 that the veritable owners
 take away what is theirs."

 "Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened by the Lord
 to what is borrowed,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'

 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 And, householder,
 it is as if in a dense forest thicket
 not far from a village or a market town
 there might be a tree
 laden with ripe fruit,
 but with no fruit fallen to the ground;
 and a man might come along
 walking about and aiming at fruit,
 seeking for fruit,
 looking about for fruit;
 having plunged into that forest thicket,
 he might see that tree
 laden with ripe fruit,
 and it might occur to him:

 'This tree is laden with ripe fruit,
 but no fruit has fallen to the ground.

 However, I know how to climb a tree.

 Suppose that I,
 having climbed this tree,
 should eat as much as I like
 and should fill my clothes?

 So he, having climbed that tree,
 might eat as much as he liked
 and might fill his clothes.[22]

 Then a second man might come [31] along
 walking about and aiming at fruit,
 seeking for fruit,
 looking about for fruit,
 and bringing a sharp axe.

 Having plunged into that forest thicket,
 he might see that tree
 laden with ripe fruit,
 and it might occur to him:

 'This tree is laden with ripe fruit
 but no fruit has fallen to the ground.
 Now, I don't know how to climb a tree,
 so suppose that I,
 having cut down this tree at the root,
 should eat as much as I like
 and should fill my clothes?

 So he might cut down this tree at the root.

 What do you think about this, householder?

 Unless he came down very quickly,
 would not that tree in falling
 crush the hand
 or the foot
 or another part of the body
 of that man who had first climbed the tree,

 [367]so that, from that cause
 he might come to death
 or to pain like unto death?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "Even so, householder,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Pleasures of the senses
 have been likened by the Lord
 to the fruits of a tree,
 of much pain,
 of much tribulation,
 wherein is more peril.'

 And having seen this thus
 as it really is
 by means of perfect wisdom,
 having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,
 resting on multiformity,
 he develops that equanimity
 which is equanimity in face of uniformity,
 resting on uniformity,
 wherein all graspings
 after the material things of the world
 are stopped entirely.

 This ariyan disciple, householder,
 who has come to this matchless purification
 through equanimity and mindfulness,
 recollects a variety of former habitations,
 that is to say:

 One birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration;
 such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.
 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.

 Thus he remembers divers former abodes in all their modes and detail.

 This ariyan disciple, householder,
 who has come to this matchless purification
 through equanimity and mindfulness,
 with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,
 sees beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of their deeds,
 and he thinks:

 Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,
 who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 who were possessed of good conduct in speech,
 who were possessed of good conduct in thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 he sees beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 he comprehends that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of their deeds.

 This ariyan disciple, householder,
 who has come to this matchless purification
 through equanimity and mindfulness,
 by the destruction of the cankers
 having here-now realised by his own super-knowledge
 the freedom of mind
 and the freedom through wisdom
 that are cankerless,
 enters and abides therein.

 It is to this extent, householder,
 that in the discipline for an ariyan
 there is an entire giving up in every way
 of all avocations.

 What do you think about this, householder?

 Do you behold in yourself
 a giving up of avocations
 such as is, in the discipline for an ariyan,
 an entire giving up in every way
 of all avocations?"

 "Who am I, revered sir,
 that there is an entire giving up
 of all [32] avocations
 in every way?

 I, revered sir,
 am far from the entire giving up in every way
 of all avocations
 according to the discipline for an ariyan.

 For hitherto we, revered sir,
 deemed wanderers belonging to other sects
 to be superior
 although they are inferior;
 although they are inferior
 we offered them food for superiors;
 although they are inferior
 we placed them
 in places for superiors.
 And we, revered sir,
 deemed monks to be inferior
 although they are superior;
 although they are superior
 we offered them food for inferiors;
 although they are superior
 we placed them in places
 for inferiors.

 But now we, revered sir,

 [368]will know that wanderers belonging to other sects,
 being inferior,
 are inferior;
 because they are inferior
 we will offer them food for inferiors;
 because they are inferior
 we will place them in places
 for inferiors.

 And we, revered sir,
 will know that monks,
 being superior,
 are superior;
 because they are superior
 we will offer them food for superiors;
 because they are superior
 we will place them in places
 for superiors.

 Indeed, revered sir,
 the Lord has inspired in me
 a recluse's regard for recluses,
 a recluse's satisfaction in recluses,
 a recluse's reverence for recluses.
 It is excellent, revered sir,
 it is excellent, revered sir.

 Revered sir, it is as if one might set upright
 what had been upset,
 or might disclose what what was covered,
 or show the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision
 might see material shapes  even so in many a figure
 has dhamma been made clear by the Lord.

 I, revered sir,
 am going to the Lord for refuge
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the Lord accept me as a lay follower
 going for refuge
 from this day forth
 for as long as life lasts."
