# 91. Discourse with Brahmāyu

## Brahmāyu Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was walking on tour in Videha
 together with a large Order of monks,
 with as many as five hundred monks.

 Now at that time the brahman Brahmāyu was living in Mithilā.

 He was worn,
 old,
 full of years,
 he had lived his span
 and was at the close of his life,
 a hundred and twenty years of age;
 he was master[1] of the three Vedas,[2]
 versed in the vocabularies and rituals
 together with the phonology and exegesis[3]
 and the legendary tradition as the fifth;
 he was learned in idioms,
 a grammarian,
 proficient in popular philosophy
 and the marks of a Great Man.[4]

 The brahman Brahmāyu heard:

 "Verily the recluse Gotama,[5]
 son of the Sakyans,
 having gone forth from the Sakyan clan,
 is walking on tour in Videha
 together with a large Order of monks,
 with as many as five hundred monks.

 The most lovely report has gone abroad thus
 concerning this revered[6] Gotama:

 'He is indeed Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,
 Well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and mankind,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 Having realised through his own super-knowledge,
 he makes known this world
 together with devas
 including the Māras and the Brahmās;
 creatures
 together with recluses and brahmans,
 with devas and mankind.
 He teaches [318] dhamma
 that is lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle
 and lovely at the ending;
 he explains with the spirit and the letter
 the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled
 and wholly purified.

 Good indeed is the sight
 of perfected ones such as this."

 Now at that time
 the brahman Brahmāyu had the brahman youth Uttara as pupil;
 he was master of the three Vedas,
 versed in the vocabularies and rituals
 together with the phonology and exegesis
 and the legendary tradition as the fifth;
 he was learned in idioms,
 a grammarian,
 proficient in popular philosophy
 and the marks of a Great Man.

 Then the brahman Brahmāyu
 addressed the brahman youth Uttara,
 saying:

 "Dear Uttara, this recluse Gotama,
 son of the Sakyans,
 having gone forth from the Sakyan clan,
 is walking on tour in Videha
 together with a large Order of monks,
 with as many as five hundred monks.

 The most lovely report has gone abroad thus
 concerning this revered Gotama:
 'He is indeed Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,
 Well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and mankind,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 Having realised through his own super-knowledge,
 he makes known this world
 together with devas
 including the Māras and the Brahmās;
 creatures
 together with recluses and brahmans,
 with devas and mankind.

 He teaches dhamma
 that is lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle
 and lovely at the ending;
 he explains with the spirit and the letter
 the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled
 and wholly purified.

 Good indeed is the sight
 of perfected ones such as this."

 Come you, dear Uttara,
 approach the recluse Gotama;
 having approached,
 find out whether the recluse Gotama is in fact
 that revered Gotama of whom the report has gone abroad
 or whether he is not,
 and whether the revered Gotama is such a one
 or not such a one.

 Through you
 will we know that revered Gotama.

 So will I,
 in virtue of what you say,
 find out whether that revered Gotama is in fact
 the revered Gotama of whom the report has gone abroad
 or whether he is not,
 and whether the revered Gotama
 is such a one
 or not such a one.

 Dear Uttara, in our mantras[7]
 the thirty-two marks of the Great Man are traditional.[8]

 For a Great Man
 possessed of these
 only two courses[9] are open,
 not another:
 If he settles in the household state
 he becomes a king[10] who is a wheel-turner,[11]
 a dhamma-man,[12]
 a king under dhamma,[13]
 the ruler of the whole world,
 one who [319] brings stability to his realm;
 and he is possessed of the seven Treasures.

 These seven Treasures of his are
 the wheel-treasure,
 the elephant-treasure,
 the horse-treasure,
 the jewel-treasure,
 the woman-treasure,
 the householder-treasure,
 the adviser-treasure as the seventh.

 He will have more than a thousand sons,
 valiant,
 built on heroic lines,[14]
 able to crush opposing armies.

 He dwells conquering this sea-girt land
 by dhamma,[15]
 not by stick,
 not by sword.

 But, if he goes forth from home
 into homelessness
 he becomes a perfected one,
 a fully Self-Awakened One,
 a lifter of the world's veil.[16]

 Now I, dear Uttara,
 am an imparter[17] of mantras,
 you are a recipient[17] of mantras."

 "Very well, sir,"
 and the brahman youth Uttara,
 having answered the brahman Brahmāyu in assent,
 rising from his seat,
 having greeted the brahman Brahmāyu,
 keeping his right side towards him,
 set out on tour (to find) the Lord in Videha.

 Walking on tour,
 he gradually approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
 the brahman youth Uttara
 looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
 on the Lord's body.

 And the brahman youth Uttara
 saw all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
 on the Lord's body
 except two.

 About these two marks of a great man
 he was in doubt,
 perplexed,
 uncertain,
 not satisfied  whether what was cloth-hid was sheath-cased
 and whether the tongue was large.

 Then it occurred to the Lord:

 "This brahman youth Uttara sees on me
 all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
 except two.

 About these two marks of a Great Man
 he is in doubt,
 perplexed,
 uncertain,
 not satisfied:
 whether what is cloth-hid is sheath-cased

 [320] and whether my tongue is large."

 Then the Lord contrived such a contrivance of psychic power[18]
 that the brahman youth Uttara saw
 that that which the Lord had cloth-hid was sheath-cased.

 Then the Lord,
 having put out his tongue,
 stroked it backwards and forwards
 over both his ears
 and he stroked it backwards and forwards
 over both his nostrils
 and he covered the whole dome of his forehead
 with his tongue.[19]

 Then it occurred to the brahman youth Uttara:

 "The recluse Gotama is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.

 Suppose I were to follow the recluse Gotama closely
 so as to watch his conduct?"

 Then for seven months the brahman youth Uttara,
 like a constant shadow,[20]
 followed the Lord closely.

 After the lapse of the seven months
 the brahman youth Uttara set out on tour for Mithilā in Videha;
 walking on tour
 he gradually approached Mithilā
 and the brahman Brahmāyu;
 having approached
 and having greeted the brahman Brahmāyu,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 Brahmāyu the brahman spoke thus to the brahman youth Uttara
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "I suppose, dear Uttara,
 that the report spread abroad about the revered Gotama
 was truly so
 and not otherwise?

 I suppose that the revered Gotama
 is such a one
 and not of another kind?"

 "Sir, the report spread abroad about the revered Gotama
 was truly so
 and not otherwise;
 this revered Gotama is such a one
 and not of another kind.

 And this revered Gotama is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man:[21]

 The revered Gotama

 The good Gotama,
 a Great Man,
 has also this mark of a Great Man.[37]

 The revered Gotama is possessed of these thirty-two marks of a Great Man.

 If the revered Gotama is walking
 he leads off with his right foot;
 he does not put the foot too far (forward),
 he does not place the foot too short;
 he does not walk too quickly;
 he does not walk too slowly;
 he does not walk
 knocking knee against knee
 or ankle against ankle;

 [323] while he is walking
 he does not bend his thighs up,
 he does not bend his thighs down,
 he does not bend his thighs in,
 he does not bend his thighs out.[38]

 As the revered Gotama walks
 he moves only with the lower part of his body
 and does not walk with his (full) bodily strength.[39]

 When he is looking around,
 the revered Gotama looks round with his whole body,[40]
 he does not look up,
 he does not look down,
 and he does not walk without observing,[41]
 for he looks (ahead) a plough's length;[42]
 further than that
 his knowledge and insight become unobstructed.[43]

 On entering into a house[44]
 he does not bend his body up,
 he does not bend his body down,
 he does not bend his body in,
 he does not bend his body out.

 He turns round
 not too far from hie seat,
 not too near it,
 and he does not sit down on the seat
 clutching hold of it with his hand,
 nor does he fling his body
 (in a slovenly way[45])
 on to the seat.[46]

 When he is seated in a house
 he does not fall into unseemly behaviour with his hands,[47]
 he does not fall into unseemly [324] behaviour with his feet;[48]
 he does not sit down
 crossing knee over knee
 or ankle over ankle,
 nor does he sit down
 holding his jaw in his hand.

 When he is seated in a house
 he is not afraid,
 does not tremble,
 shake
 or quiver  and so is the revered Gotama
 when he is sitting in a house
 unafraid,
 untrembling,
 not shaking,
 not quivering,
 unruffled,
 intent on aloofness.

 When he is receiving water for the bowl
 he does not turn the bowl up,
 he does not turn the bowl down,
 he does not turn the bowl inwards,
 he does not turn the bowl outwards;
 he receives neither too little
 nor too much water for the bowl.

 He washes the bowl
 without making it clatter,[49]
 he washes the bowl without twirling it round;
 not until he has put the bowl down on the ground
 does he wash his hands;
 by the time the hands are washed
 the bowl is washed;
 by the time the bowl is washed
 the hands are washed.

 He throws away the water for the bowl
 not too far,
 not too near,
 and without scattering it.

 When he is receiving boiled rice,
 he does not turn the bowl up,
 he does not turn the bowl down,
 he does not turn the bowl inwards,
 he does not turn the bowl outwards;
 he receives neither too little
 nor too much boiled rice.

 The revered Gotama eats the proper proportion of curry (to rice[50])
 and he does not neglect (the rice)
 with each mouthful of curry.

 The revered Gotama swallows each mouthful
 only after having turned it round
 two or three times in his mouth;
 there is not a single grain of boiled rice
 that enters his body
 without having been broken up,
 and not a single grain of boiled rice
 remains in his mouth
 before he proceeds to the (next) mouthful.
 The revered Gotama eats food
 experiencing its flavour
 but not experiencing greed for the flavour.

 The revered Gotama eats food
 that is possessed of the eight characteristics[51]
 but not for fun
 or indulgence
 or personal charm
 or beautification,
 but just enough for the support of his body
 and keeping it going,
 for keeping it unharmed,
 for furthering the Brahma-faring,
 thinking:

 'Thus will I crush out an old feeling
 and not allow a new feeling to arise,
 and then there will be subsistence for me
 and blamelessness
 and abiding in comfort.'[52]|| ||

 When he has eaten
 and is accepting water for the bowl,
 he does not [325], turn the bowl up,
 he does not turn the bowl down,
 he does not turn the bowl inwards,
 he does not turn the bowl outwards.

 He receives neither too little
 nor too much water for the bowl.

 He washes the bowl
 without making it clatter,
 he washes the bowl without twirling it round;
 not until he has put the bowl down on the ground
 does he wash his hands;
 by the time the hands are washed
 the bowl is washed;
 by the time the bowl is washed
 the hands are washed.

 He throws away the water for the bowl
 not too far,
 not too near,
 and without scattering it.

 When he has eaten,
 he places the bowl on the ground,
 not too far,
 not too near,
 for he is not without concern for the bowl[53]
 yet he is not over-protective of the bowl.

 When he has eaten,
 he sits silent for a moment,
 but he does not let pass
 the time for giving thanks.

 When he has eaten,
 he gives thanks.

 He does not decry that meal,
 he does not hope for another meal;
 on the contrary he delights,
 rouses,
 inspires,
 gladdens that assembly
 with talk on dhamma.

 When he has delighted,
 roused,
 inspired,
 gladdened that assembly
 with talk on dhamma,
 rising from his seat,
 he departs.

 He does not walk too quickly,
 he does not walk too slowly,
 he does not walk (as if) anxious
 to get free (of that assembly).[54]

 The revered Gotama's robe
 is not pulled up too high on his body,
 it is not pulled down too low;[55]
 and neither does it stick to his body,[56]
 nor is it drawn away from his body,[57]
 and neither does the wind
 blow the revered Gotama's robe about on his body,[58]
 nor do dust and dirt
 cling to the revered Gotama's body.

 When he has gone to a monastery
 he sits down on an appointed seat
 and while sitting down
 he cleanses his feet[59]  but the revered Gotama does not live
 intent on the practice of beautifying his feet.

 When he has cleansed his feet
 he sits down cross-legged,
 holding the body erect
 and arousing mindfulness in front of him.

 He does not strive after hurt of self,
 he does not strive after hurt of others,
 he does not strive after hurt of both.[60]
 The revered Gotama sits down
 striving only after weal of self,
 weal of others,
 weal of both,
 weal of the whole world.

 When, in a monastery, he is teaching dhamma in an assembly,
 he does not exalt that assembly,
 he does not disparage that assembly;
 on the contrary he delights,
 rouses,
 inspires, [326] gladdens that assembly
 with talk on dhamma.

 The sound that issues from the revered Gotama's mouth[61]
 is possessed of eight characteristics:
 it is distinct
 and intelligible
 and sweet
 and audible
 and fluent[62]
 and clear
 and deep
 and resonant.

 Wherefore when the revered Gotama
 instructs an assembly by voice
 the sound does not carry beyond that assembly.

 These, after being delighted,
 roused,
 inspired,
 gladdened by the revered Gotama
 with talk on dhamma,
 rising from their seats,
 depart reluctantly,
 keeping their gaze on him.

 We, sir, have seen that revered Gotama walking,
 we have seen him standing still,
 we have seen him sitting silent within a house,
 we have seen him eating in a house,
 we have seen him sitting silent after he has eaten,
 we have seen him giving thanks after he has eaten,
 we have seen him going to a monastery,
 we have seen him sitting silent in a monastery,
 we have seen him in a monastery
 teaching dhamma in an assembly.

 This revered Gotama is like this
 and like that
 and even more so."[63]

 When this had been said, Brahmāyu the brahman,
 rising from his seat,
 having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
 having saluted the Lord with joined palms,
 three times uttered this solemn utterance:

 "Praise to that Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 "Praise to that Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.

 "Praise to that Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One.
 Perhaps somewhere,
 sometime
 we might meet this revered Gotama,
 perhaps there might be some conversation between us."

 Then the Lord, walking on tour in Videha,
 in due course arrived at Mithilā.

 While he was there
 the Lord stayed near Mithilā in Makhādeva's Mango Grove.

 Brahmans and householders of Mithilā heard:

 "Verily the recluse Gotama,
 son of the Sakyans,
 having gone forth from the Sakyan clan,
 is walking on tour in Videha
 together with a large Order of monks,
 with as many as five hundred monks.

 The most lovely report has gone abroad thus
 concerning the revered Gotama:

 'He is indeed Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,
 Well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and mankind,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 Having realised through his own super-knowledge,
 he makes known this world
 together with devas
 including the Māras and the Brahmās;
 creatures
 together with recluses and brahmans,
 with devas and mankind.

 He teaches dhamma
 that is lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle
 and lovely at the ending;
 he explains with the spirit and the letter
 the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled
 and wholly purified.

 Good indeed is the sight
 of perfected ones such as this."

 Then the brahmans and householders of Mithilā
 approached the Lord:
 some, having approached
 and having greeted the Lord,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, after they had exchanged greetings with the Lord
 and had conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 sat down at a [327] respectful distance;
 some, after saluting the Lord with joined palms,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, having made known to the Lord the name of their clan,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, becoming silent,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 The brahman Brahmāyu heard:

 "Verily the recluse Gotama,
 son of the Sakyans,
 gone forth from the Sakyan clan,
 has arrived at Mithilā
 and is staying near Mithilā
 in Makhadeva's Mango Grove."

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman
 together with a number of brahman youths
 approached Makhādeva's Mango Grove.

 When Brahmāyu the brahman was near the Mango Grove
 it occurred to him:

 "It is not suitable in me
 that I should approach to see the recluse Gotama
 without being announced first."

 So Brahmāyu the brahman addressed a certain brahman youth,
 saying:

 "Come you, brahman youth,
 approach the recluse Gotama;
 having approached,
 in my name ask the recluse Gotama whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort,
 saying:

 'Good Gotama, Brahmāyu the brahman
 is asking whether the revered Gotama is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort';
 and then speak thus:
 "Good Gotama, Brahmāyu the brahman is worn,
 old,
 full of years,
 he has lived his span
 and is at the close of his life,
 a hundred and twenty years of age;
 he was master of the three Vedas,
 versed in the vocabularies and rituals
 together with the phonology and exegesis
 and the legendary tradition as the fifth;
 he was learned in idioms,
 a grammarian,
 proficient in popular philosophy
 and the marks of a Great Man.

 Of all the brahmans and householders, sir,
 who live in Mithilā,
 Brahmāyu the brahman is pointed to
 as chief in respect of wealth,
 Brahmāyu the brahman is pointed to
 as chief in respect of mantras,
 Brahmāyu the brahman is pointed to
 as chief in respect of longevity
 as well as of renown.

 He is anxious to see the good Gotama."

 "Very well, sir,"
 and the brahman youth, having answered the brahman Brahmāyu in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he Stood at a respectful distance.
 As he was standing at a respectful distance,
 the brahman youth spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Good Gotama, the brahman Brahmāyu is asking whether the revered Gotama is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort.

 The brahman Brahmāyu, good Gotama, is worn, old,
 full of years,
 he has lived his span
 and is at the close of his life,
 a hundred and twenty years of age;
 he was master of the three Vedas,
 versed in the vocabularies and rituals
 together with the phonology and exegesis
 and the legendary tradition as the fifth;
 he was learned in idioms,
 a grammarian,
 proficient in popular philosophy
 and the marks of a Great Man.

 Of all the brahmans and householders, sir,
 who live in Mithilā,
 Brahmāyu the [328] brahman is pointed to
 as chief in respect of wealth,
 Brahmāyu the brahman is pointed to
 as chief in respect of mantras,
 Brahmāyu the brahman is pointed to
 as chief in respect of longevity
 as well as of renown.

 He is anxious to see the good Gotama."
 "Brahmāyu the brahman must now do
 that for which he deems it the right time,
 brahman youth."

 Then that brahman youth
 approached Brahmāyu the brahman;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to Brahmāyu the brahman:

 "Permission has been given[64] revered sir,
 by the recluse Gotama.

 Revered sir, you may now do
 that for which you deem it the right time."

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman approached the Lord.

 His assembly saw the brahman Brahmāyu coming in the distance.

 Having seen him,
 they, standing each at his own side,[65]
 made room for him
 because he was well known and renowned.

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman spoke thus to that assembly:

 "No, good sirs,
 you sit down each on your own seat,
 I will sit here
 near the recluse Gotama."

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
 having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Brahmāyu the brahman looked for
 the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
 on the Lord's body.

 And Brahmāyu the brahman saw
 all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
 on the Lord's body
 except two.

 About these two marks of a Great Man
 he was in doubt,
 perplexed,
 uncertain,
 not satisfied  whether what was cloth-hid was sheath-cased
 and whether the tongue was large.

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman addressed the Lord in verses:

 "Of these thirty-two marks of a Great Man of which I have heard
 There are two that I do not see on your body, Gotama.
 I wonder whether what is cloth-hid is sheath-cased, Supreme of men?
 Or is it female? I wonder whether the tongue is not short?
 I wonder whether you have a long tongue. So that I might know this,
 Put forth this tongue, dispel our doubt, Seer.
 For welfare here and now, and for bliss in a future state
 We ask for permission (to see) that which we long (to know)."

 [329] Then it occurred to the Lord:

 "This brahman Brahmāyu sees on me
 all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man except two.

 About these two marks of a Great Man
 he is in doubt,
 perplexed,
 uncertain,
 not satisfied  whether what is cloth-hid is sheath-cased
 and whether my tongue is large."

 Then the Lord contrived such a contrivance of psychic power
 that the brahman Brahmāyu saw
 that that which the Lord had cloth-hid was sheath-cased.

 Then the Lord, having put out his tongue,
 stroked it backwards and forwards
 over both his ears
 and he stroked it backwards and forwards
 over both his nostrils
 and he covered the whole dome of his forehead
 with his tongue.

 Then the Lord responded in verses
 to the brahman Brahmāyu:

 "Those thirty-two marks of a Great Man of which you have heard
 Are all on my body. Do not you doubt them, brahman.
 What[66] is to be known is known by me, and to be developed is developed,
 What is to be got rid of has been got rid of - therefore, brahman, am I Awake.[67]
 For welfare here and now and for bliss in a future state
 Do ask for permission (to see) that which you long (to know)."

 Then it occurred to the brahman Brahmāyu:

 "Permission has been given me by the recluse Gotama.

 Suppose I were to ask the recluse Gotama
 about the goal either of the here and now
 or of a future state?"

 But then it occurred to the brahman Brahmāyu:
 "I myself am skilled in the goals of the here and now,
 and others ask me about the goal of the here and now.

 Suppose I were to ask the recluse Gotama
 simply about the goal of a future state?"

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman addressed the Lord in verses:

 "How is one a brahman? How does one become master of knowledge?
 How is one a threefold knowledge-man? Who is called learned?
 How is one perfected? How does one become whole?
 And how is one a sage? Who is called Awake?"

 Then the Lord responded in verses
 to the brahman Brahmāyu:

 [330] "Who knows his former habitations and sees heaven and the sorrowful ways,
 Who has attained destruction of births,[68] accomplished by super- knowledge, a Sage is he.
 Who knows his mind is quite pure, freed from every attachment,
 Who has got rid of birth and dying, in the Brahma-faring Whole is he.[69]
 Who is master of all states of mind,[70] such a one Awake is called."

 When this had been said,
 Brahmāyu the brahman,
 rising from his seat,
 arranging his upper robe over one shoulder,
 having inclined his head to the Lord's feet,
 kissed the Lord's feet on all sides
 with his mouth
 and stroked them on all sides
 with his hands,
 and he made known his (own) name:[71]

 "I, good Gotama, am Brahmāyu, the brahman."
 Then that company was filled with wonder and marvel,
 and said:

 "Indeed it is wonderful,
 indeed it is marvellous
 how great is the psychic power
 and the majesty
 of the recluse
 in virtue of which
 this Brahmāyu the brahman,
 well known and renowned,
 pays such deep respect."

 Then the Lord spoke thus
 to Brahmāyu the brahman:

 "Enough, brahman, rise up;
 do sit down on your own seat
 since your mind was pleased with me."

 Then the brahman Brahmāyu,
 having risen up,
 sat down on his own seat.

 Then the Lord gave a talk to Brahmāyu the brahman
 on various topics:[72]
 talk on giving,
 talk on moral habit,
 talk on heaven;
 he explained the peril,
 the vanity,
 the depravity of the pleasures of the senses,
 the advantage in renouncing them.

 When the Lord knew
 that the mind of Brahmāyu the brahman was ready,
 malleable,
 devoid of the hindrances,
 uplifted,
 pleased,
 then he explained to him
 that teaching on dhamma
 that the Awakened Ones have themselves discovered:
 anguish,
 uprising,
 stopping,
 the Way.

 And as a clean cloth
 without black specks
 will easily take dye,
 even so as Brahmāyu the brahman was (sitting) on that very seat
 did dhamma-vision,
 dustless and stainless,
 arise in him:
 that

 "whatever is liable to origination
 all that is liable to stopping."

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman,
 having seen dhamma,
 attained dhamma,
 known dhamma,
 plunged into dhamma,
 having crossed over doubt,

 [331] put away uncertainty
 and attained without another's help
 to full confidence in the Teacher's instruction,
 spoke thus to the Lord:
 "It is excellent, good Gotama;
 it is excellent, good Gotama.

 Even, good Gotama,
 as one might set upright
 what had been upset,
 or disclose what was covered,
 or show the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 thinking that those with vision might see material shapes,
 even so is dhamma made clear
 in many a figure
 by the good Gotama.

 So I am going to the revered Gotama (for refuge)[73]
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.

 May the revered Gotama accept me
 as a lay-disciple
 going for refuge
 from this day forth
 for as long as life lasts.

 And may the revered Gotama
 consent to a meal with me
 on the morrow
 together with the Order of monks."

 The Lord consented by becoming silent.

 Then Brahmāyu the brahman,
 having understood the Lord's consent,
 rising up from his seat,
 having greeted the Lord,
 departed keeping his right side towards him.

 Then the brahman Brahmāyu
 having had sumptuous foods,
 solid and soft,
 prepared in his own dwelling
 towards the end of that night,
 had the time announced to the Lord,
 saying:

 "It is time, good Gotama,
 the meal is ready."

 Then the Lord,
 having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 approached the dwelling of Brahmāyu the brahman;
 having approached,
 he sat down on the appointed seat
 together with the Order of monks.

 Then did Brahmāyu the brahman
 for seven days
 with his own hand
 serve and satisfy the Order of monks
 with the Awakened One at its head
 with sumptuous foods,
 solid and soft.

 Then at the end of the seven days
 the Lord set out on tour in Videha.

 Not long after the Lord had set out
 Brahmāyu the brahman passed away.
 Then a number of monks approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 they sat down at a respectful distance.

 As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,
 these monks spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir,
 Brahmāyu the brahman has passed away.

 What is his bourn,
 what his future state?"

 "Clever,[74] monks,
 was the brahman Brahmāyu;
 he followed after dhamma
 according to various parts of dhamma,[75]
 and he did not [332] annoy me[76]
 with questionings about dhamma.

 Monks, Brahmāyu the brahman,
 by the complete destruction of the five fetters
 binding to this lower (shore),
 is of spontaneous uprising,
 one who attains nibbāna there,
 not liable to return from that world."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
