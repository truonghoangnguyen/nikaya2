# 123. Discourse on Wonderful and Marvellous Qualities

## Acchariya-Bhuta-Dhamma Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then this conversation arose among a number of monks
 who, having returned from the alms-gathering after the meal,
 were seated gathered together in an assembly hall:

 "Wonderful,[1] your reverences,
 marvellous, your reverences,
 are the great psychic power
 and the great majesty
 of the Tathāāgata
 inasmuch as he should know[2]
 of former Awakened Ones[3]
 who have attained nibbāna
 with the impediments[4] cut off,
 the whirligig cut through,[5]
 the rolling on finished[6]
 and all anguish spent,[7]
 that these Lords were of such a family
 and that these Lords were of such a name
 and that these Lords were of such a clan
 and that these Lords were of such moral habit
 and that these Lords were of such mental habits[8]
 and that these Lords were of such intuitive wisdom
 and that these Lords were of such an abiding[9]
 and that these Lords were of such freedom."[10]

 [164] When this had been said,
 the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to these monks:

 "Indeed, your reverences, Tathāgatas are wonderful
 and possessed of wonderful qualities;
 indeed, your reverences, Tathāgatas are marvellous
 and possessed of marvellous qualities."

 And this was the conversation of these monks
 that was interrupted.

 Then the Lord,
 emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,
 approached the assembly hall;
 having approached,
 he sat down on the appointed seat.

 As he was sitting down,
 the Lord addressed the monks,
 saying:
 "What, monks, were you talking about just now?

 What was your conversation that was interrupted?"

 "Revered sir, when we had returned from the alms-gathering after the meal
 and were seated gathered together in the assembly hall,
 this conversation arose among us:

 "Wonderful, your reverences,
 marvellous, your reverences,
 are the great psychic power
 and the great majesty
 of the Tathāāgata
 inasmuch as he should know
 of former Awakened Ones
 who have attained nibbāna
 with the impediments cut off,
 the whirligig cut through,
 the rolling on finished
 and all anguish spent,
 that these Lords were of such a family
 and that these Lords were of such a name
 and that these Lords were of such a clan
 and that these Lords were of such moral habit
 and that these Lords were of such mental habits
 and that these Lords were of such intuitive wisdom
 and that these Lords were of such an abiding
 and that these Lords were of such freedom."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to these monks:

 "Indeed, your reverences, Tathāgatas are wonderful
 and possessed of wonderful qualities;
 indeed, your reverences, Tathāgatas are marvellous
 and possessed of marvellous qualities."
 This was our conversation, revered sir, that was interrupted.

 And then the Lord arrived."

 Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:

 "Wherefore, Ānanda, deliver[11] at greater length
 the Tathāāgata's wonderful and marvellous qualities."

 "Face to face with the Lord, revered sir,

 'The Bodhisatta arose in the Tusita group[12]
 mindful and clearly conscious, Ānanda.'

 'When, Ānanda, the Bodhisatta,
 having deceased from the Tusita group,
 entered his mother's womb,
 then an illimitable glorious radiance,
 surpassing even the deva-majesty of devas,
 appeared in the world
 with its devas,
 its Māras,
 its Brahmās,
 among the generations
 with recluses and brahmans,
 devas and men.

 And even in those spaces between the worlds,[14]
 gloomy,[15]
 baseless,[16]
 regions of blackness
 plunged in blackness,
 where the moon and the sun,
 powerful and majestic though they are,
 cannot make their light prevail[17]  even there
 there appeared the illimitable glorious radiance,
 surpassing even the deva-majesty of devas.

 And those beings who had uprisen there[18]
 recognised one another
 by means of this radiance,
 and they thought:

 "Indeed there are other beings
 who are uprising here."
 And this ten-thousand-world-system quaked,
 trembled
 and shook,
 and there appeared there
 the illimitable glorious radiance [166] surpassing even the deva-majesty of devas.'

 restrained from the occasions of slothfulness
 resulting from (drinking) strong intoxicants.'[20]

 the Bodhisatta's mother is at ease,
 her body not tired;
 and within her [167] womb the Bodhisatta's mother sees the Bodhisatta,
 complete in all his limbs,
 his sense-organs perfect.[21]

 As, Ānanda, an emerald jewel[22]
 of lovely water
 and well cut into eight facets
 might be strung on a thread  a deep green
 or yellow
 or red
 or white
 or an orange-coloured thread,
 and as a man with vision,
 having taken it in his hand,
 might reflect:

 "This is an emerald jewel
 of lovely water,

 while she is standing.'[24]

 And inasmuch, revered sir, as while other women give birth
 sitting or lying down,

 having received him,
 place him in front of his mother,
 saying:

 "Rejoice, lady,
 mighty is the son that is born to you."[25]

 Face to face with the Lord, revered sir,
 have I heard this,

 'When, Ānanda, the Bodhisatta is issuing from his mother's womb,
 he issues quite stainless,
 undefiled by watery matter,
 undefiled by mucus,
 undefiled by blood,
 undefiled by any impurity,
 pure and unstained.

 Ānanda, it is as when a jewel is laid on Benares muslin,
 neither does the jewel stain the Benares muslin
 nor does the Benares muslin stain the jewel.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is due to the purity of both.

 Even so, Ānanda, when the Bodhisatta is issuing from his mother's womb,
 he issues quite stainless,
 undefiled by watery matter,
 undefiled by mucus,
 undefiled by blood,
 undefiled by any impurity,
 pure and unstained.'

 Face to face with the Lord, revered sir,
 have I heard this,

 'The moment, Ānanda, the Bodhisatta has come to birth,
 standing on even feet
 and facing north,
 he takes seven strides,[27]
 and while a white sunshade is being held over him,
 he scans all the quarters[28]
 and utters as with the voice of a bull:[29]

 "I am chief in the world,
 I am best in the world,
 I am eldest in the world.

 This is the last birth,

 there is not now again-becoming."'

 And inasmuch, [169] revered sir, as the moment the Bodhisatta has come to birth,

 regions of blackness
 plunged in blackness,
 where the moon and the sun,
 powerful and majestic though they are,
 cannot make their light prevail  even there
 there appeared the illimitable glorious radiance,
 surpassing even the deva-majesty of devas.

 And those beings who had uprisen there
 recognised one another
 by means of this radiance,
 and they thought:

 "Indeed there are other beings
 who are uprising here."
 And this ten-thousand-world-system quaked,
 trembled
 and shook,
 and there appeared there
 the illimitable glorious radiance surpassing even the deva-majesty of devas.

 ■

 "Wherefore do you, Ānanda, regard this too as a wonder,
 a marvellous quality of the Tathāāgata's:

 As to this, Ānanda,
 the feelings that arise in the Tathāgata are known;
 known they persist;
 known they go to destruction;
 perceptions are known;
 known they persist;
 known they go to destruction;
 the thoughts that arise are known;
 known they persist;
 known they go to destruction.

 So do you, Ānanda, regard this too as a wonder,
 a marvellous quality of the Tathāāgata's."

 "Inasmuch, revered sir, as the feelings that arise in the Lord are known;
 known they persist;
 known they go to destruction;[30]
 perceptions are known;
 known they persist;
 known they go to destruction;
 the thoughts that arise are known;
 known they persist;
 known they go to destruction  I regard this too, revered sir,
 as a wonder,
 a marvellous quality of the Lord's."

 Thus spoke the venerable Ānanda.

 The Teacher approved.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced
 in what the venerable Ānanda, had said.
