# 97. Discourse with Dhānanjāni

## Dhānanjāni Sutta

#### Thus have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding-place.

 Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta was walking on tour
 near the Northern Mountain[1]
 together with a large Order of monks.

 Then a certain monk
 who had spent the rains near Rājagaha
 approached the Northern Mountain
 and the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way
 he sat down at a respectful distance.
 The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus
 to this monk
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "I hope, your reverence,
 that the Lord is well and strong?"

 "The Lord is well and strong, your reverence."

 "And I hope, your reverence,
 that the Order of monks is well and strong?"

 "The Order of monks is also well and strong, your reverence."

 "There is there, your reverence,
 a brahman named Dhānañjāni
 near the Taṇḍulapāla Gateway.[2]

 I hope, your reverence,
 that the brahman named Dhānañjāni
 is well and strong?"

 "Your reverence, the brahman Dhānañjāni is also well and strong."

 "I hope, your reverence,
 that the brahman Dhānañjāni is being diligent?"

 "How could the brahman Dhānañjāni be diligent, your reverence?

 Under the king's patronage, your reverence,
 the brahman Dhānañjāni plunders brahman householders;
 and under the patronage of the brahman householders
 he plunders the king.

 His wife
 who had faith
 and whom he had married
 from a family that has faith
 has died,
 and he has married another wife
 who has no faith
 and who comes from a family that has no faith."

 "This is indeed bad hearing,
 your reverence;
 indeed, your [373] reverence,
 it is bad hearing
 that we hear the brahman Dhānañjāni is negligent.

 Perhaps sometime,
 somewhere
 we might meet the brahman Dhānañjāni,
 perhaps there might be some conversation."

 Then the venerable Sāriputta,
 having stayed near the Northern Mountain for as long as he found suitable,
 set out on tour for Rājagaha.

 Walking on tour
 he gradually arrived at Rājagaha.

 While he was there
 the venerable Sāriputta stayed near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove
 at the squirrels' feeding-place.

 Then the venerable Sāriputta,
 dressing in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Rājagaha for almsfood.

 Now at that time the brahman Dhānañjāni was having cows milked
 in a cow-pen outside the town.
 When the venerable Sāriputta, had walked for alms in Rājagaha
 and was returning from the alms-gathering
 after the meal,
 he approached the brahman Dhānañjāni.

 The brahman Dhānañjāni saw the venerable Sāriputta coming in the distance;
 seeing him,
 he approached the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:

 "Drink some of this milk, good Sāriputta,
 until it is time for a meal."

 "No, brahman,
 I have finished with eating for today.

 I will take my day-sojourn
 at the root of a tree  you could come there."

 "Yes, sir,"
 the brahman Dhānañjāni answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 Then when the brahman Dhānañjāni had had breakfast,
 he approached the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus
 to the brahman Dhānañjāni
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "I hope that you are being diligent, Dhānañjāni?"
 "How could I be diligent, good Sāriputta,
 when there are my parents to support,
 my wife and children to support,
 my slaves,
 servants
 and work-people to support,
 when there are services to perform[3] for friends and acquaintances,
 services to perform for kith and kin,
 services to perform for guests,
 rites to perform[3] for the ancestors,
 rites to perform for the devatās, duties to perform[3] for the king  and this body too must be satisfied and looked after."

 "What do you think about this, Dhānañjāni?

 Suppose someone were a non-dhamma-farer,
 an uneven-farer
 because of his parents;
 because of his non-dhamma-faring,
 uneven-faring
 the guardians of Niraya Hell
 might drag him off to Niraya Hell.

 Would he gain [374] anything by saying:

 'I was a non-dhamma-farer,
 an uneven-farer
 because of my parents  do not let the guardians of Niraya Hell
 (drag) me off to Niraya Hell'?

 Or would his parents gain anything for him
 by saying:

 'It was because of us
 that he was a non-dhamma-farer,
 an uneven-farer  do not let the guardians of Niraya Hell
 (drag) him off to Niraya Hell'?"

 "No, good Sāriputta,
 for the guardians of Niraya Hell
 would hurl him wailing
 into Niraya Hell itself."

 Then Dhānañjāni the brahman,
 having rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said,
 having given thanks,
 rising from his seat departed.

 Then after a time
 the brahman Dhānañjāni was ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted.

 Then the brahman Dhānañjāni summoned a man,
 and said:

 "Come you, my good man,
 approach the Lord;
 having approached,
 in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head,
 saying:

 'Revered sir, Dhānañjāni the brahman is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted;
 he salutes the Lord's feet with his head';

 and then approach the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached,
 in my name salute the venerable Sāriputta's feet with your head,
 saying:
 'Revered sir, Dhānañjāni the brahman is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted;
 he salutes the venerable Sāriputta's feet with his head';
 and then say:

 'It would be good indeed, revered sir,
 if the venerable Sāriputta
 would approach the dwelling of the brahman Dhānañjāni,
 out of compassion.'"

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 and this man,
 having answered the brahman [376] Dhānañjāni in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 this man spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, Dhānañjāni the brahman is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted;
 he salutes the Lord's feet with his head."

 And then he approached the venerable Sāriputta;
 having approached,
 having greeted the venerable Sāriputta,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 this man spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:

 "Revered sir, Dhānañjāni the brahman is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted;
 he salutes the venerable Sāriputta's feet with his head";

 It would be good indeed, revered sir,
 if the venerable Sāriputta
 would approach the dwelling of the brahman Dhānañjāni,
 out of compassion."

 Then the venerable Sāriputta,
 having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 approached the dwelling of the brahman Dhānañjāni;
 having approached,
 he sat down on the appointed seat.

 As he was sitting down
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the brahman Dhānañjāni:

 "I hope that you, Dhānañjāni,
 are better,
 I hope you are keeping going.

 I hope the painful feelings are decreasing,
 not increasing,
 and that a decrease in them is apparent,
 not an increase?"

 "No, good Sāriputta,
 I am no better,
 I am not keeping going.

 My grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not decreasing,
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a decrease.
 Good Sāriputta, as[7] a strong man
 might cleave one's head
 with a sharp-edged sword,
 even so, good Sāriputta,
 do exceedingly loud winds rend my head.

 I am no better, good Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going.

 My grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not decreasing,
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a decrease.

 As, good Sāriputta, a strong man
 might clamp a turban on one's head
 with a tight leather strap,
 even so, good Sāriputta,
 do I have very bad headaches.

 I am no better, good Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going.

 My grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not decreasing,
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a decrease.

 As, good Sāriputta, a skilled cattle butcher
 or his apprentice
 might cut through the stomach
 with a sharp butcher's knife,
 even so, good Sāriputta,
 do very strong winds cut through my stomach.

 I am no better, good Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going.
 My grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not decreasing,
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a decrease.

 As, good Sāriputta, two strong men,
 having taken hold of a weaker man by his limbs,
 might set fire to him,
 might make him sizzle up over a charcoal pit,
 even so, good Sāriputta, there is a fierce heat in my body.

 I am no better, good Sāriputta,
 I am not keeping going.

 [377] My grievously painful feelings are increasing,
 not decreasing,
 an increase in them is apparent,
 not a decrease.

 "What do you think about this, Dhānañjāni?

 Which is better:
 the devas that have power over the creations of others or the Brahma- world?"

 "The revered Sāriputta said 'Brahma-world,'
 the revered Sāriputta said 'Brahma-world.'"

 Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:

 "These brahmans are very intent on the Brahma-world.
 Suppose I were to show the brahman Dhānañjāni
 the way to companionship with Brahmā?

 Dhānañjāni, I will show you the way to companionship with Brahmā.

 Listen to it,
 attend carefully,
 and I will speak."

 [378] "Yes, sir,"
 the brahman Dhānañjāni answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.

 The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus;

 "And which, Dhānañjāni, is the way to companionship with Brahmā?

 As to this, Dhānañjāni, a monk dwells, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwelt having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of friendliness
 that was far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 This, Dhānañjāni, is a way to companionship with Brahmā.

 And again, Dhānañjāni, a monk dwells, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of compassion,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwelt having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of compassion
 that was far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 This, Dhānañjāni, is a way to companionship with Brahmā.

 ■

 And again, Dhānañjāni, a monk dwells, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of sympathetic joy,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwelt having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of sympathetic joy
 that was far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 This, Dhānañjāni, is a way to companionship with Brahmā.

 ■

 And again, Dhānañjāni, a monk dwells, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of equanimity,
 likewise the second,
 likewise the third,
 likewise the fourth;
 just so above,
 below,
 across;
 he dwelt having suffused the whole world
 everywhere,
 in every way,
 with a mind of equanimity
 that was far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 "Well then, good Sāriputta,
 in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head,
 and say:

 'Lord, the brahman Dhānañjāni is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted;
 he salutes the Lord's feet with his head.'

 "Then, although there was something further to be done,
 the venerable Sāriputta established the brahman Dhānañjāni
 (only) in the less,
 in a Brahma-world[9]
 and, rising from his seat,
 he departed.

 Soon after the venerable Sāriputta had gone,
 the brahman Dhānañjāni passed away,
 and arose in the Brahma-world.[10]

 Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks, although there was something further to be done,
 this Sāriputta established the brahman Dhānañjāni
 (only) in the less,
 in the Brahma-world,
 and rising from his seat,
 he is departing."

 Then the venerable Sāriputta approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Lord, the brahman Dhānañjāni is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously afflicted;
 he salutes the Lord's feet with his head."

 [379] "But why did you, Sāriputta,
 although there was something further to be done,
 having established the brahman Dhānañjāni
 (only) in the less,
 in the Brahma-world,
 rising from your seat, depart?"[11]

 "It occurred to me, Lord:

 'These brahmans are very intent on the Brahma-world.

 Suppose I were to show the brahman Dhānañjāni
 the way to companionship with Brahmā?"

 "Sāriputta, the brahman Dhānañjāni has died
 and has uprisen in the Brahma-world."
