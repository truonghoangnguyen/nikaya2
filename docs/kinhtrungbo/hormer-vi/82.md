# 82. Discourse with Raṭṭhapāla

## Raṭṭhapāla Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord,
 walking on tour among the Kurus
 together with a large Order of monks
 arrived at the market [251] town of the Kurus
 called Thullakoṭṭhita.

 The brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard:

 "Indeed the recluse Gotama,
 the son of the Sakyans,
 gone forth from the Sakyan family,
 walking on tour among the Kurus
 together with a large Order of monks
 has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita.
 A lovely report about the revered Gotama has gone forth thus:

 'This Lord is perfected,
 wholly Self-Awakened,
 endowed with (right) knowledge and conduct,
 well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and men,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 He makes known this world
 with the devas,
 with Māra,
 with Brahma,
 creation with its recluses and brahmans,
 its devas and men,
 having realised them
 by his own super-knowledge.

 With the meaning and the spirit
 he teaches dhamma
 that is lovely in the beginning,
 lovely in the middle,
 lovely at the ending;
 he proclaims the Brahma-faring wholly fulfilled,
 quite purified.

 It were good to see perfected ones like this.'"

 Then the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 some, having greeted the Lord,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some exchanged greetings with the Lord,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, becoming silent,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 As the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita
 were sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the Lord gladdened,
 roused,
 incited
 and delighted them
 with a talk on dhamma.

 Now at that time
 a young man of family
 named Raṭṭhapāla,[1]
 the son of a leading family
 in that very Thullakoṭṭhita,
 was sitting down in this assembly.

 Then it occurred to Raṭṭhapāla,
 the young man of family:[2]

 "In so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is no easy matter for one living in a house
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled,
 completely pure
 and polished like a conch-shell.
 Suppose that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 Then the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita,
 gladdened,
 roused,
 incited
 and delighted
 by the Lord's talk on dhamma,
 rejoicing [252] in what the Lord had said
 and giving thanks for it,
 rising from their seats
 and greeting the Lord,
 departed keeping their right sides towards him.

 And not long after the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita had departed,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance;
 sitting down at a respectful distance,
 he spoke thus to the Lord:

 "In so far as I, revered sir,
 understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is no easy matter
 for one living in a house
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled,
 completely pure
 and polished like a conch-shell.
 I wish, revered sir,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 to go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 May I, revered sir,
 receive the going forth
 in the Lord's presence,
 may I receive ordination."

 "But have you, Raṭṭhapāla,
 your parents consent
 for going forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 "I have not, revered sir,
 the consent of my parents
 for going forth from home
 into homelessness."

 "Raṭṭhapāla, Tathāgatas do not allow (one[3]) to go forth
 without the consent of the parents."

 "I, revered sir,
 will do whatever is necessary
 so that my parents will consent
 to my going forth from home
 into homelessness."

 Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 having greeted the Lord
 keeping his right side towards him,
 rising from his seat
 approached his parents;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to his parents:

 "Mother and father,
 in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is no easy matter
 for one living in a home
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled,
 completely pure,
 and polished like a conch-shell.

 I wish,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 to go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 Consent to my going forth from home
 into homelessness."

 When this had been said,
 the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 are our only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself
 with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 We do not consent [253]
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 we should be desolate without you.

 How could we,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 ■

 And a second time Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to his parents:

 "Mother and father, in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is no easy matter
 for one living in a home
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled,
 completely pure,
 and polished like a conch-shell.

 I wish,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 to go forth from home
 into homelessness.
 Consent to my going forth from home
 into homelessness."

 And a second time,
 when this had been said,
 the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 are our only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself
 with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 We do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 we should be desolate without you.

 How could we,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?"
 ■

 And a third time Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to his parents:

 "Mother and father, in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,
 it is no easy matter
 for one living in a home
 to fare the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled,
 completely pure,
 and polished like a conch-shell.

 I wish,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 to go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 Consent to my going forth from home
 into homelessness."

 And a third time,
 when this had been said,
 the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 are our only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself
 with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 We do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 we should be desolate without you.

 How could we,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 ■

 Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 not receiving his parents' consent,
 lay down there on the bare ground
 and said:

 "Here will there be death for me
 or going forth."

 Then the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking,
 amusing yourself
 you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 We do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 we should be desolate without you.

 How could we,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 When this had been said,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 was silent.

 ■

 And a second time the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking,
 amusing yourself
 you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 We do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 we should be desolate without you.

 How could we,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 And a second time, when this had been said,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 was silent.

 ■

 And a third time the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking,
 amusing yourself
 you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 We do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 we should be desolate without you.

 How could we,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 And a third time, when this had been said,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 was silent.

 ■

 Then the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 approached his friends;
 having approached,
 they spoke thus to them;

 "This Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 is lying down on the bare ground, dears,
 and saying:

 'Here will there be death for me
 or going forth.'

 Come, dears,
 approach Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family;
 having approached,
 speak thus to him:

 'You, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 are your parents' only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and [254] amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 Your parents do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 your parents would be desolate without you.

 How can they,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?'"

 ■

 Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 having answered his parents in assent,
 approached Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family;
 and having approached,
 they spoke thus to him:

 "You, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 are your parents' only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself

 Your parents do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 your parents would be desolate without you.
 How can they,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?'"

 When this had been said,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 was silent.

 ■

 And a second time the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to him:

 "You, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 are your parents' only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat aiul drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself
 with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.

 Your parents do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.
 If you were to die
 your parents would be desolate without you.

 How can they,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?'"

 And a second time,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 was silent.

 ■

 And a third time
 did the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 speak thus to him:

 "You, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 are your parents' only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 eat aiul drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself
 with sense-pleasures
 and doing meritorious things.
 Your parents do not consent
 that you should go forth from home
 into homelessness.

 If you were to die
 your parents would be desolate without you.

 How can they,
 while you are living,
 consent to your going forth from home
 into homelessness?'"

 And a third time,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 was silent.

 ■

 Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 approached his parents;
 and having approached,
 they spoke thus to them:

 "Mother and father,
 this Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 is lying on the bare pound there saying:

 'Here will there be death for me
 or going forth.'

 If you do not consent
 that Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 should go forth from home into homelessness,
 he will die there.

 But if you consent
 to his going forth from home into homelessness,
 after he has gone forth
 you may see him again.

 If Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 does not enjoy the going forth from home
 into homelessness,
 what alternative will there be for him?

 He will come back here.

 Consent to the going forth from home
 into homelessness
 of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family."

 "We consent, dears,
 to the going forth from home
 into homelessness
 of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family.

 But after he has gone forth,
 he must come and see us."

 Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 approached him;
 and having approached,
 they spoke thus to him:

 "You, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 are your parents' only child,
 dear and beloved,
 you live in comfort
 and are well cared for;
 you, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 do not know anything of suffering.

 Get up,
 eat and drink
 and amuse yourself;
 eating,
 drinking
 and amusing yourself,
 you can enjoy diverting yourself
 with sense-pleasures
 and doing [255] meritorious things.

 Your parents have consented
 to your going forth from home
 into homelessness,
 but after you have gone forth
 you must see your parents."

 Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 having got up
 and regained his strength,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "I, revered sir,
 have my parents' consent
 for the going forth from home
 into homelessness.

 May the Lord let me go forth."

 Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 received the going forth
 in the Lord's presence,
 he received ordination.
 Not long after the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had been ordained  half a month after he had been ordained  the Lord, having stayed for as long as he found suitable in Thullakoṭṭhita,
 set out on tour for Sāvatthī;
 and in due course,
 walking on tour,
 he arrived at Sāvatthī.

 While he was there
 the Lord stayed near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove
 in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 dwelling alone,
 aloof,
 diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 having soon realised
 here and now
 by his own super-knowledge
 that incomparable goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which
 young men of family
 rightly go forth from home
 into homelessness,
 entering on it,
 he abided in it.

 And he knew:
 "Destroyed is birth,
 brought to a close the Brahma-faring,
 done is what was to be done,
 there is no more of being such or so.

 "And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla
 was one of the perfected ones.

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to the Lord:

 "I want, revered sir,
 to see my parents,
 if the Lord allows me."

 Then the Lord
 with his mind carefully reflected
 on the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's reasoning of mind.

 When the Lord knew
 that it was impossible for the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 throwing off the training,
 to return to the secular life,
 then the Lord spoke thus
 to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla:

 "Do now, Raṭṭhapāla,
 that for which you think it is the right time."

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 rising from his seat,
 having greeted the Lord
 keeping his right side towards him,
 having packed away his bedding,
 set out on tour for Thullakoṭṭhita
 taking his bowl and robe;
 and in due course,
 walking on tour,
 he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita.

 [256] While he was there,
 the venerable Raṭṭhapāla stayed near Thullakoṭṭhita
 in the deer-park of the Kuru king.

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 dressing in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Thullakoṭṭhita for almsfood;
 while he was walking on an uninterrupted round for almsfood,
 he approached his own parents' house.

 Now at that time the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father
 was having his hair combed
 in the middle hall
 which had a door.[4]

 He saw the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, coming in the distance,
 and seeing him,
 he spoke thus:

 "Our only son,
 dear and beloved,
 has gone forth among these shaveling recluses."

 And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 received neither alms nor a refusal[5]
 at his own father's house;
 all he received was abuse.
 Now at that time
 the woman slave of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations
 wanted to throw away
 the previous evening's barley-gruel.

 But the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to her:

 "If that, sister,
 is to be thrown away,
 put it here in my bowl."

 Then as the woman slave
 of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations
 was putting the previous evening's barley-gruel
 into his bowl
 she recognised his hands and feet and voice.

 So the woman slave
 of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations
 approached his mother,
 and having approached,
 she spoke thus to her:

 "If it please you, madam,
 you should know
 that the young master Raṭṭhapāla is back."

 "Now then, if you speak the truth,
 you are a freed woman."

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's mother
 approached his father;
 and having approached,
 she spoke thus to his father:

 "If it please you, householder,
 you should know that Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 is indeed back."

 Now at that time
 the venerable Raṭṭhapāla was eating the previous evening's barley-gruel
 in a room provided for the purpose.[6]

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father approached him;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to him:

 "Can it be, dear Raṭṭhapāla,

 [257] that you are eating last evening's barley-gruel?

 Surely, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 you should come into your own home?"

 "Where, householder, is there a home
 for us who have gone forth from home
 into homelessness?

 We are houseless ones, householder.

 I did come to your home, householder;
 but I received neither alms there
 nor a refusal;
 all I received was abuse."

 "Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 we will go to the house."

 "No, householder,
 I have done with eating for today."

 "Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 consent to a meal on the morrow."
 The venerable Raṭṭhapāla consented
 by becoming silent.

 And when the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father
 had understood that he had consented,
 he went up to his own dwelling;
 and having gone there,
 he had a great heap made
 of gold coins and gold,
 and having had them hidden with screens,
 he summoned the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's former wives,
 and said:

 "Come you, daughters-in-law,
 adorn yourselves with the adornments
 adorned with which
 you used to be dear to Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,
 and beloved by him."

 And towards the end of that night
 the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father,
 having had sumptuous foods,
 solid and soft,
 prepared in his own dwelling,
 had the time announced
 to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 saying:

 "It is time, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 the meal is ready."

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,
 having dressed in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 approached his own father's dwelling;
 having approached,
 he sat down on the seat made ready.

 And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father,
 having had that heap of gold coins and gold uncovered,
 spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla:

 "This, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 is your mother's wealth,
 the other is your father's,
 the other your paternal grandfather's.[7]

 It is possible, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 both to enjoy riches
 and do meritorious things.

 Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 throwing off the training
 and returning to the secular life,
 enjoy riches
 and do meritorious things."

 "If you, householder,
 would do my bidding,
 having loaded this heap of gold coins and gold into wagons,
 and then having had it brought down,
 you would have it dropped
 in the middle stream of the river Ganges.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is from that source, householder,
 that there will arise for you
 grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair."

 Taking hold of his feet,
 the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's former wives

 [258] then spoke thus to him:

 "How, young master,
 of what kind
 are those nymphs
 for whose sake you fare the Brahma-faring?"

 "We, sisters, do not fare the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of nymphs."

 Saying,

 "The young master Raṭṭhapāla
 addresses us with the word 'sisters,'"

 they fell down fainting just there.

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla
 spoke thus to his father:

 "If you would give food, householder,
 give it;
 but do not annoy us."

 "Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 the meal is ready."

 Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father
 with his own hand
 served and satisfied the venerable Raṭṭhapāla
 with sumptuous food,
 solid and soft.
 And when the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had eaten
 and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,
 standing he spoke these verses:[8]

 "See[9] the pranked-out puppet-shape,[10] a mass of sores, a congeries,[11]
 afflicted, much thought of,[12] for which there is never stability.

 See the pranked-out form with jewels and rings,
 the bones sheathed in skin, resplendent with the clothes,

 The feet dyed with lac, the face with powder smeared  enough for delusion of a fool, but not for the quester of the Beyond.

 Hair braided eightfold, eyes with collyrium smeared  enough for delusion of a fool, but not for the quester of the Beyond.

 Like a new collyrium-box, embossed, is the foul body, adorned  enough for delusion of a fool, but not for the quester of the Beyond.

 The trapper set a snare; the deer touched not the net.
 Having eaten the crop, we go while the deer-catchers lament."

 [259] After the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had spoken these verses while he was standing,
 he approached the deer-park of the Kuru king;[13]
 having approached,
 he sat down for the day-sojourn
 at the root of a tree.

 Then the Kuru king addressed a trapper,[14] saying:
 "Clear a pleasure-ground, good trapper,
 in the deer-park;
 we will go to see the lovely ground."

 "Yes, sire,"

 and when the trapper had answered the Kuru king in assent,
 he saw, while he was clearing the deer-park,
 the venerable Raṭṭhapāla sitting down for the day-sojourn
 at the root of a tree;
 on seeing him,
 he approached the Kuru king,
 and having approached,
 he spoke thus to him:

 "Sire, the deer-park is cleared;
 but there is the young man of family, Raṭṭhapāla,
 the son of a leading family near this very Thullakoṭṭhita,
 and whom yon have constantly praised,
 sitting at the root of a tree
 for the day-sojourn."

 "Well then, good trapper,
 no more now today of the pleasure-ground,
 but we will now at once
 pay respects to the revered Raṭṭhapāla."

 And when he had said:

 "Give away all the solid and soft food
 that has been prepared,"

 he had many lovely vehicles harnessed,
 and having mounted a lovely vehicle,
 he set forth from Thullakoṭṭhita
 in great royal pomp
 with the many lovely vehicles
 so as to see the venerable Raṭṭhapāla.

 Having gone by vehicle
 for as far as the ground was passable,
 and having then descended from the vehicle,
 with his princely train
 he approached the venerable Raṭṭhapāla on foot;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the venerable Raṭṭhapāla;
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he stood at a respectful distance.

 As he was standing at a respectful distance,
 the Kuru king spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla:

 "Let the revered Raṭṭhapāla
 sit down here on the elephant-rug."[15]

 [260] "No, sire; you sit down,
 I am sitting on a seat of my own."

 The Kura king sat down
 on the prepared seat;
 while he was sitting down
 the Kuru king spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla:

 "Good Raṭṭhapāla,
 there are these four kinds of loss
 followed by which
 some (men) here,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 go forth from home into homelessness.

 What are the four?
 Loss through old age,
 loss through illness,
 loss of wealth,
 loss of relations.

 ■

 And what, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 is loss through old age?

 As to this, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 someone is worn,
 old,
 full of years,
 has lived his span
 and is at the close of his life.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am now worn,
 old,
 full of years,
 I have lived my span
 and am at the close of my life,
 so it is not easy for me
 to acquire wealth not already acquired
 or to use to advantage
 the wealth already acquired.

 Suppose that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?

 So he, following[ed1] this loss through old age,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 goes forth from home into homelessness.

 Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called
 loss through old age.

 But the revered Raṭṭhapāla is still young,
 endowed with the coal-black hair of radiant youth,
 in his early prime,
 and there is none of this loss through old age
 for the revered Raṭṭhapāla.

 What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known
 or seen
 or heard
 that he has gone forth from home
 into homelessness?

 ■

 And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is
 loss through illness?

 As to this, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 someone is ill,
 in pain,
 grievously ill.

 He reflects thus:

 'I am now ill,
 in pain,
 grievously ill,
 so it is not easy for me
 to acquire wealth not already acquired
 or to use to advantage
 the wealth already acquired.
 Suppose that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?

 So he, following this loss through illness,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 goes forth from home
 into homelessness.

 Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called
 loss through illness.

 But the revered Raṭṭhapāla is still free from illness,
 not ailing,
 possessed of a good digestion
 that is neither too cold
 nor too hot,
 and there is none of this loss through illness
 for the revered Raṭṭhapāla.

 What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known
 or seen
 or heard
 that he has gone forth from home
 into homelessness?

 ■

 And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is
 loss of wealth?

 As to this, good [261] Raṭṭhapāla,
 someone is rich,
 of great possessions,
 very wealthy,
 but gradually these riches of his diminish.

 He reflects thus:

 'Formerly I was rich,
 of great possessions,
 very wealthy,
 but gradually these riches of mine
 have diminished,
 so it is not easy for me
 to acquire wealth not already acquired
 or to use to advantage
 the wealth already acquired.

 Suppose that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?

 So he, following this loss through wealth,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 goes forth from home
 into homelessness.

 Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called
 loss of wealth.

 But the revered Raṭṭhapāla is the son of a leading family
 in this very Thullakoṭṭhita,
 and there is none of this loss of wealth
 for the revered Raṭṭhapāla.

 What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known
 or seen
 or heard
 that he has gone forth from home
 into homelessness?

 ■

 And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is
 loss of relations?

 As to this, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 someone has many friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 but gradually these relations of his diminish.

 He reflects thus:

 'Formerly I had many friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 but gradually these relations of mine have diminished,
 so it is not easy for me
 to acquire wealth not already acquired
 or to use to advantage
 the wealth already acquired.

 Suppose that I,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 should go forth from home
 into homelessness?

 So he, following this loss through relations,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 goes forth from home
 into homelessness.
 Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called
 loss of relations.

 But the revered Raṭṭhapāla has many friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 in this very Thullakoṭṭhita,
 and there is none of this loss of relations
 for the revered Raṭṭhapāla.

 What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known
 or seen
 or heard
 that he has gone forth from home
 into homelessness?

 ■

 These, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 are the four kinds of loss
 followed by which
 some (men) here,
 having cut off hair and beard,
 having donned saffron garments,
 go forth from home into homelessness.

 But there are none of these
 for the revered Raṭṭhapāla.

 What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known
 or seen
 or heard
 that he has gone forth from home
 into homelessness?"

 "There are, sire,
 four expoundings of Dhamma
 expounded by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One;
 because I have known
 and seen
 and heard these
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness.

 What are the four?

 The first expounding of Dhamma
 expounded by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One is that:

 'The unstable world
 is brought to an end.'[16]

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth [262] from home
 into homelessness.

 The second expounding of Dhamma
 expounded by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One is that:
 'The world is no refuge,
 no guard.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness.

 The third expounding of Dhamma
 expounded by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One is that:

 'The world is not one's own,
 one must go
 leaving everything.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness.

 The fourth expounding of Dhamma
 expounded by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One is that:

 'The world lacks and is unsatisfied,
 a slave to craving.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home into homelessness.

 These, sire, are the four expoundings of Dhamma
 expounded by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One;
 because I have known
 and seen
 and heard these
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness."

 "The good Raṭṭhapāla says:

 'The unstable world
 is brought to an end.'

 But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood,
 good Raṭṭhapāla?"

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Were you,
 at the age of twenty
 or twenty-five,
 expert in (handling) an elephant
 and a horse
 and a chariot
 and a bow
 and a sword,
 strong of leg and arm,
 able[17] and proficient in warfare?"
 "I, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 at the age of twenty
 or twenty-five,
 was expert in (handling) an elephant
 and a horse
 and a chariot
 and a bow
 and a sword,
 I was strong of leg and arm,
 able and proficient in warfare;
 methinks I was sometimes inspired;
 I saw none equal to myself in strength."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Are you still so strong in leg and arm,
 able and proficient in warfare?"

 "No, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 I am now worn,
 old,
 full of years,
 I have lived my span
 and am at the close of my life  round eighty years of age.

 Sometimes, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 when I want to take a step in one direction
 I step in another."[18]

 "It was in reference to this, sire,
 that the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, said:
 'The unstable world [263]
 is brought to an end.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness."

 "It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 that this was so well spoken
 by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, that:

 'The unstable world
 is brought to an end.'

 For, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 the unstable world
 is brought to an end.

 ■

 Now, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 in this royal family
 are squadrons of elephants
 and squadrons of horses
 and squadrons of chariots
 and squadrons of infantry
 which, if we were in distress,
 would defend us.[19]

 The good Raṭṭhapāla says:
 'The world is no refuge,
 no guard.'

 But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood,
 good Raṭṭhapāla?"

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Have you any chronic illness?"

 "I have a chronic illness of wind,
 good Raṭṭhapāla.

 Sometimes friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin
 stand round me, saying:

 'Now the Kuru king will pass away,
 now the Kuru king will pass away.'"

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Would you be able to say
 to friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin:

 'Let the good friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 ease my pain,
 let them all share this feeling
 so that I could experience
 a more buoyant feeling?

 Or do you have to experience that feeling alone?"

 "I, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 am not able to say to friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin:

 'Let the good friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 ease my pain,
 let them all share this feeling
 so that I could experience
 a more buoyant feeling.

 So I have to experience that feeling alone."

 "It was in reference to this, sire,
 that the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, said:

 'The world is no refuge,
 no guard.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness."

 "It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 that this was so well spoken
 by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, that:

 'The world is no refuge,
 no guard.'
 For, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 the world is no refuge,
 no guard.

 ■

 Now, Raṭṭhapāla,
 in this royal family
 is an abundance of gold coins and gold,
 both in the ground
 and above it.[20]

 The good [264] Raṭṭhapāla says:

 'The world is not one's own,
 one must go
 leaving everything.'

 But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood,
 good Raṭṭhapāla?"

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Although you at present
 divert yourself
 endowed with
 and possessed of
 the five strands of sense-pleasures,
 will you hereafter be able to say:

 'Even so am I diverting myself
 endowed with
 and possessed of
 these same five strands of sense-pleasures?'

 Or will others
 come into this wealth
 while you go on
 according to kamma?"

 "Although I at present, dear Raṭṭhapāla,
 divert myself
 endowed with
 and possessed of
 the five strands of sense-pleasures,
 I will not hereafter be able to say:

 'Even so am I diverting myself
 endowed with
 and possessed of
 these same five strands of sense-pleasures.'

 So others will come into this wealth
 while I go on
 according to kamma"

 "It was in reference to this, sire,
 that the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, said:

 'The world is not one's own,
 one must go
 leaving everything.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness."

 "It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 that this was so well spoken
 by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, that:

 'The world is not one's own, one must go leaving everything.'

 For, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 the world is not one's own,
 one must go
 leaving everything.

 ■

 Now, the good Raṭṭhapāla says:

 'The world lacks and is unsatisfied,
 a slave to craving.'

 But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood,
 good Raṭṭhapāla?"

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Is the Kuru you dwell in as master,[21]
 prosperous?"

 "Yes, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 the Kuru I dwell in as master is prosperous."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 If a trustworthy,
 reliable man
 were to come to you here from the east
 and having approached you
 should say:

 'If it please you, sire,
 you should know that I am coming from the east,
 and have seen a great country there,
 rich,
 prosperous,
 thronged with people;
 there were many squadrons of elephants there,
 squadrons of horses,
 squadrons of chariots,
 squadrons of infantry;
 there is much ivory there,
 much gold
 both unwrought [265]
 and wrought,
 many women are there.

 And it is possible to conquer it
 with such and such a force.

 Conquer it, sire.'

 What would you do?"

 "When I had conquered it, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 I should dwell in it as master."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 If a trustworthy,
 reliable man
 were to come to you here from the west
 and having approached you
 should say:
 'If it please you, sire,
 you should know that I am coming from the east,
 and have seen a great country there,
 rich,
 prosperous,
 thronged with people;
 there were many squadrons of elephants there,
 squadrons of horses,

 squadrons of infantry;
 there is much ivory there,
 much gold
 both unwrought
 and wrought,
 many women are there.

 And it is possible to conquer it
 with such and such a force.

 Conquer it, sire.'

 What would you do?"

 "When I had conquered it, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 I should dwell in it as master."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 If a trustworthy,
 reliable man
 were to come to you here from the north
 and having approached you
 should say:

 'If it please you, sire,
 you should know that I am coming from the east,
 and have seen a great country there,
 rich,
 prosperous,
 thronged with people;
 there were many squadrons of elephants there,
 squadrons of horses,
 squadrons of chariots,
 squadrons of infantry;
 there is much ivory there,
 much gold
 both unwrought
 and wrought,
 many women are there.

 And it is possible to conquer it
 with such and such a force.

 Conquer it, sire.'

 What would you do?"

 "When I had conquered it, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 I should dwell in it as master."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 If a trustworthy,
 reliable man
 were to come to you here from the south
 and having approached you
 should say:

 'If it please you, sire,
 you should know that I am coming from the east,
 and have seen a great country there,
 rich,
 prosperous,
 thronged with people;
 there were many squadrons of elephants there,

 And it is possible to conquer it
 with such and such a force.

 What would you do?"

 "When I had conquered it, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 I should dwell in it as master."

 "It was in reference to this, sire,
 that the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, said:

 'The world lacks and is unsatisfied,
 a slave to craving.'

 Because I have known
 and seen
 and heard this
 I have gone forth from home
 into homelessness."

 "It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 that this was so well spoken
 by the Lord who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One, that:

 'The world lacks
 and is unsatisfied,
 a slave to craving.'

 For, good Raṭṭhapāla,
 the world lacks,
 it is unsatisfied,
 it is a slave to craving."

 The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said this;
 having said this,
 he further spoke thus;[22]

 "I see men of wealth in the world acquiring property, from delusion they give not away;
 out of greed a hoard of wealth they make,
 and hanker sorely after more sense-pleasures.

 A king, having forcibly conquered the earth,
 inhabiting a land with the ocean its confines,
 not satisfied with this side of the sea
 hankers after the sea's further side too.

 Kings and full many another man
 come to their dying their cravings not gone;

 [266] as those that still lack they put off the body;
 yet in the world is no satisfaction in sense-pleasures.[23]

 Letting down their hair, kinsmen bewail him
 and say: 'Alas, he is not undying.'
 Bearing him wrapped in a shroud,
 kindling a pyre, they cremate him then.

 Being prodded by stakes, he burns
 in the one garment, riches got rid of.
 Not to one who is dying are kinsfolk a refuge
 any more than are friends or intimates here.

 Heirs carry off his wealth;
 but the being goes on according to kamma.
 Wealth does not follow him who is dying,
 nor child or wife, nor wealth or kingdom.

 Long life is not gained from wealth,
 nor is old age banished by property.
 'For brief is this life,' the wise say,
 non-eternal, subject to change.

 Rich and poor feel the touch,[24]
 fool and wise are touched alike.
 But the fool, as though struck down by folly, prostrate lies,
 while the wise, touched by the touch, trembles not.

 Wherefore better than wealth is wisdom
 by which one here secures accomplishment.[25]
 Not being accomplished in this-becoming or that,[26] they do evil deeds from delusion.

 [267] He comes to a womb and to another world,
 being bound to samsara,[27] in a successive (round);
 one of little wisdom, having faith in him,
 comes to a womb and to another world.

 As a thief of evil nature, caught in the act
 of breaking in, is ruined[28] by his own kamma,
 so the race, of evil nature, is hereafter,
 in another world, ruined by its own kamma.

 Divers sweet, delightful sense-pleasures
 in various ways disturb the mind;
 having seen the peril in sense-pleasures,
 I, O sire, have therefore gone forth.

 As fruits from the tree, so fall men,
 both young and old, on the break up of the body.
 Having seen[29] this too, I have gone forth, sire.
 Better indeed is sure recluseship."
