# 117. Discourse Pertaining to the Great Forty

## Mahā Cattārīsaka Sutta

#### Thus I have heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I will teach you, monks, the ariyan[1] right concentration [114] [2]
 with the causal associations,[3]
 with the accompaniments.[4]
 Listen to it,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "And what, monks, is the ariyan right concentration
 with the causal associations,
 with the accompaniments?

 It is right view,
 right purpose,
 right speech,
 right action,
 right mode of livelihood,
 right endeavour,
 right mindfulness.

 Whatever one-pointedness of mind, monks,
 is accompanied by these seven components,
 this, monks, is called
 the ariyan right concentration
 with the causal associations
 and the accompaniments.

 ■

 As to this, monks, right view comes first.[5]

 And how, monks, does right view come first?

 If one comprehends that wrong view is wrong view
 and comprehends that right view is right view,
 that is his right view.[6]
 And what, monks, is wrong view?

 'There is no (result of) gift,[7]
 there is no (result of) offering,
 there is no (result of) sacrifice;
 there is no fruit or ripening of deeds
 well done or ill done;
 there is not this world,
 there is not a world beyond;
 there is no (benefit from serving) mother,
 no (benefit from serving) father;
 there are no spontaneously arising beings;
 there are not in the world
 recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly,
 proceeding rightly,
 and who proclaim this world
 and the world beyond,
 having realised them by their own super-knowledge.'

 This, monks, is a wrong view.

 And what, monks, is right view?

 Now, I, monks, say that right view is twofold.

 There is, monks, the right view that has cankers,
 that is on the side of merit,
 that ripens unto cleaving
 (to new [115] birth).[8]

 There is, monks, the right view that is ariyan,
 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a component of the Way.

 And what, monks, is the right view
 that has cankers,
 that is on the side of merit,
 that ripens unto cleaving
 (to new birth)?

 'There is (result of) gift,
 there is (result of) offering,
 there is (result of) sacrifice;
 there is fruit or ripening of deeds
 well done or ill done;
 there is this world,
 there is a world beyond;
 there is (benefit from serving) mother,
 (benefit from serving) father;
 there are spontaneously arising beings;
 there are in the world
 recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly,
 proceeding rightly,
 and who proclaim this world
 and the world beyond,
 having realised them by their own super-knowledge.'[9]

 This, monks, is a right view
 that has cankers,
 is on the side of merit,
 that ripens unto cleaving
 (to new birth).

 And what, monks is the right view
 that is ariyan,
 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a component of the Way?

 Whatever, monks, is wisdom,
 the cardinal faculty of wisdom,[10]
 the power of wisdom,[11]
 the component of enlightenment
 that is investigation into things,[12]
 the right view that is a component of the Way
 in one who, by developing the ariyan Way,
 is of ariyan thought,
 cankerless thought,
 conversant with the ariyan Way[13]  this, monks, is a right view
 that is ariyan,
 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a component of the Way.

 Whoever makes endeavour
 for the riddance of wrong view,
 for the attainment of right view,
 that is his right endeavour.

 Mindful, he gets rid of wrong view;
 mindful, entering on right view,
 he abides in it.

 This is his right mindfulness.

 Thus these three things circle round
 and follow after right view,
 that is to say:

 right view,
 right endeavour,
 right mindfulness.

 As to this, monks, right view comes first.

 And how, monks, does right view come first?
 If one comprehends

 And what, monks, is wrong purpose?

 Purpose for sense-pleasures,
 purpose for ill-will,
 purpose for harming.

 This, monks, is wrong purpose.

 And what, monks, is right purpose?

 Now I, monks, say that right purpose is twofold.

 [116]

 There is, monks, the right purpose

 (to new birth).

 There is, monks, the right purpose

 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a factor of the Way.

 And what, monks, is the right purpose

 Purpose for renunciation,
 purpose for non-ill-will,
 purpose for non-harming.

 This, monks, is right purpose
 that has cankers,
 is on the side of merit,
 and ripens unto cleaving

 And what, monks, is the right purpose
 that is ariyan,
 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a component of the Way?

 Whatever, monks, is reasoning,[14]
 initial thought,[15] purpose,
 an activity of speech
 through the complete focussing[16]
 and application of the mind
 in one who, by developing the ariyan Way,
 is of ariyan thought,
 of cankerless thought,
 and is conversant with the ariyan Way  this, monks, is right purpose
 that is ariyan,
 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a component of the Way.

 Whoever makes endeavour
 for the riddance of wrong purpose,
 for the attainment of right purpose,
 that is his right endeavour.
 Mindful, he gets rid of wrong purpose;
 mindful, entering on right purpose
 he abides in it.

 That is his right mindfulness.

 Thus these three things circle round
 and follow after right purpose,
 that is to say:

 right view,
 right endeavour,
 right mindfulness.

 abstaining from harsh speech,
 abstaining from gossiping.

 This, monks, is the right speech
 that has cankers,
 is on the side of merit,
 that ripens unto cleaving

 And what, monks, is the right speech
 that is ariyan,

 a component of the Way?

 Whatever, monks, is [117] abstention from,
 refraining from,
 avoidance of,
 restraint from[17]
 the four ways of bad conduct in speech[18]
 in one who, by developing the ariyan Way
 is of ariyan thought,
 of cankerless thought,
 and is conversant with the Way  this, monks, is right speech
 that is ariyan,
 cankerless,
 supermundane,
 a component of the Way.

 Whoever makes endeavour

 for the attainment of right speech,
 that is his right endeavour.

 Mindful, he gets rid of wrong speech;
 mindful, entering on right speech,
 he abides in it.

 That is his right mindfulness.

 right mindfulness.

 Onslaught on creatures,
 taking what has not been given,
 wrong enjoyment among the sense-pleasures.[18]

 This, monks, is wrong action.

 And what, monks, is right action?

 Now, I, monks, say that right action is twofold.

 There is, monks, the right action

 right mode of livelihood proceeds from right action;
 right endeavour proceeds from right mode of livelihood;
 right mindfulness proceeds from right endeavour;
 right concentration proceeds from right mindfulness;

 In this way, monks,
 the learner's course is possessed of eight components,
 the perfected one's of ten components.

 ■

 As to this, monks, right view comes first.

 And how, monks, does right view come first?

 Wrong view, monks, is worn away
 in one of right view;[28]
 and those various evil unskilled things
 that arise conditioned by wrong view
 are worn away in him;
 and various skilled things
 conditioned by right view
 come to development and fulfilment.

 Wrong purpose, monks, is worn away
 in one of right purpose;
 and those various evil unskilled things
 that arise conditioned [120] by wrong purpose
 are worn away in him;
 and various skilled things

 come to development and fulfilment.

 Wrong speech, monks,
 is worn away in one of right speech;
 and those various evil unskilled things
 that arise conditioned by wrong speech

 So, monks, there are twenty (components) on the side of skill,[29]
 twenty on the side of unskill.

 The disquisition on dhamma
 pertaining to the Great Forty
 that has been rolled on
 is not to be rolled back
 by a recluse or brahman
 or a deva
 or a Māra
 or a Brahmā
 or by anyone in the world.

 Monks, whatever recluse or brahman
 should think that this disquisition on dhamma
 pertaining to the Great Forty
 should be censured,
 should be scorned,
 ten ways of speaking
 from the standpoint of dhamma[30]
 give grounds for censuring him here and now:[31]
 if the worthy one censures right view
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong view
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 the worthies to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right thought
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong thought
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right speech
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong speech
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right action
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong action
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right mode of livelihood
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong mode of livelihood
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right endeavour
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong endeavour
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right mindfulness
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong mindfulness
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right concentration
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong concentration
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right knowledge
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong knowledge
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled;
 if the worthy one censures right freedom
 then those recluses and brahmans who are of wrong freedom
 are the worthies to be honoured,
 to be extolled.

 Monks, whatever recluse or brahman
 should think that this disquisition on dhamma
 pertaining to the Great Forty
 should be censured,
 should be scorned,
 these ten ways of speaking
 from the standpoint of dhamma
 give grounds for censuring him here and now.

 Monks, even those who were the people of Ukkala[32]
 and the Vassas

 [121] and Bhaññas,[33]
 deniers of cause,
 deniers of the effecting (by cause),
 affirmers of 'There is not'[34]  even these would think that the disquisition on dhamma
 pertaining to the Great Forty
 should not be censured,
 should not be scorned.

 What is the reason for this?

 The fear of blame,
 of attack
 and reproach."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
