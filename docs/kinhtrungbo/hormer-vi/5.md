# 5. Discourse on No Blemishes

## Anaṅgaṇa Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:

 "Reverend monks."

 "Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.|| ||

 Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:

 "Your reverences, these four kinds of persons[2] are found existing in the world.[3]

 What are the four?
 Your reverences, there is here some person with a blemish[4] who thinks:

 'I have a subjective blemish,'

 but who does not comprehend it as it really is.

 And there is the person with a blemish who, thinking:

 'I have a subjective blemish,'

 comprehends it as it really is.

 There is here the person without a blemish who thinks:

 'I have no subjective blemish,'

 but who does not comprehend it as it really is.

 And there is the person without a blemish who, thinking:

 'I have no subjective blemish,'

 comprehends it as it really is.

 Where, your reverences,
 there is this person with a subjective blemish who thinks,

 'I have a subjective blemish,'

 but does not comprehend it as it really is,
 this one, of these two persons with a blemish,
 is shown to be the inferior man.[5]

 Where, your reverences,
 there is a person with a subjective blemish who thinks,

 'I have a subjective blemish,'
 and comprehends it as it really is,
 this one, of these two persons with a blemish,
 is shown to be the best man.

 Where, your reverences,
 there is a person without a subjective blemish who thinks,

 'I have no subjective blemish,'

 but does not comprehend it as it really is,
 this one, of these two persons without a blemish,
 is shown to be the inferior man.

 Where, your reverences,
 there is a person without a subjective blemish who thinks,

 'I have no subjective blemish,'

 and comprehends it as it really is,
 this one, of these two persons without a blemish,
 is shown to be the best man."

 When this had been said,
 the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:

 "Now, reverend Sāriputta, what is the cause,
 what the reason why,
 of these two persons with a blemish,
 one is shown as being the inferior man,
 while the other is shown as being the best man?"

 "Where, your reverence,
 there is this person with a blemish who thinks:

 'I have a subjective blemish,'
 but who does not comprehend it as it really is,
 this may be expected for him:
 that he will not generate desire,
 or strive,
 or stir up energy
 for getting rid of that blemish;
 he will pass away while he has attachment,
 aversion,
 and confusion,
 while he has the blemish,
 while his mind is tarnished.

 Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,
 brought back from a shop or smithy
 covered with dust and dirt
 and that the owners would not make use of or clean,
 but would throw away in the dust.

 In consequence, your reverence,
 would that bronze bowl
 become more tarnished with dirt after a time?"

 "Yes, your reverence."

 "Even so, your reverence,
 for that person with a blemish who thinks:

 'I have a subjective blemish,'

 but does not comprehend it as it really is,
 this is to be expected:
 that he will not generate desire,
 or strive,
 or stir up energy
 for getting rid of that blemish;
 he will pass away while he has attachment,
 aversion,
 confusion,
 while he has the blemish,
 while his mind is tarnished.

 Where, your reverence,
 there is this person with a blemish who thinks:

 'I have a subjective blemish,'

 and comprehends it as it really is,
 this may be expected for him:
 that he will generate desire,
 and strive,
 and stir up energy
 for getting rid of that blemish;
 he will pass away without attachment,
 without aversion,
 without confusion,
 without the blemish,
 his mind untarnished.

 Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,
 brought back from a shop or smithy
 covered with dust and dirt,
 but which the owners would use
 and would clean,
 and would not throw away in the dust.

 In consequence, your reverence,
 would that bronze bowl
 become more clean after a time with the cleaning?"

 "Yes, your reverence."

 "Even so, your reverence,
 for that person with a blemish who thinks:
 'I have a subjective blemish,'

 and who comprehends it as it really is,
 this is to be expected:
 that he will generate desire
 and strive,
 and stir up energy
 for getting rid of that blemish;
 he will pass away without attachment,
 without aversion,
 without confusion,
 without the blemish,
 his mind untarnished.

 Where, your reverence,
 there is this person without a blemish who thinks,

 'I have no subjective blemish,'

 but who does not comprehend it as it really is,
 this may be expected for him:
 that he will attend to the fair aspect (of things);
 because of attention to the fair aspect,
 attachment will deprave his mind;
 he will pass away while he has attachment,
 aversion
 and confusion,
 while he has a blemish,
 while his mind is tarnished.

 Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,
 brought back from a shop or smithy
 quite pure,
 quite clean,
 but which its owners would neither use nor clean,
 but would throw away in the dust.
 In consequence, your reverence,
 would that bronze bowl
 become more tarnished with dirt
 after a time?"

 "Yes, your reverence."

 "Even so, your reverence,
 for that person without a blemish who thinks:

 'I have no subjective blemish,'

 but who does not comprehend it as it really is,

 that he will attend to the fair aspect (of things);

 there is this person without a blemish who thinks,

 'I have no subjective blemish'

 and comprehends it as it really is,
 this may be expected for him:
 that he will not attend to the fair aspect (of things);
 because there is no attention to the fair aspect,
 attachment will not deprave his mind;
 he will pass away without attachment,
 without aversion,
 without confusion,
 without a blemish,
 his mind untarnished.

 Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,
 brought back from a shop or smithy
 quite pure,
 quite clean,
 but which the owners would use and would clean,
 and would not throw away in the dust.

 "Yes, your reverence."

 his mind untarnished.

 This, reverend Moggallāna,
 is the cause,
 this the reason why,
 of these two persons with a blemish,
 the one is shown to be the inferior man,
 while the other is shown to be the best man.

 This, reverend Moggallāna,
 is the cause,
 this the reason why,
 of these two persons without a blemish,
 the one is shown to be the inferior man,
 while the other is shown to be the best man."

 "'Blemish, blemish,'
 is it called, your reverence?

 Now, of what is this a synonym, your reverence,
 that is to say
 'blemish'?"

 "Your reverence, this  that is to say 'blemish'  is a synonym for being occupied with evil unskilled wishes.

 ■

 This, your reverence  that is to say 'blemish'  is a synonym for being occupied with evil unskilled wishes.

 In whatever monk, your reverence,
 it is seen and also heard
 that these occupations with evil unskilled wishes
 are not destroyed  even though he be a forest-dweller
 whose lodgings are remote,
 one who walks for almsfood
 on continuous almsround,[10]
 a rag-robe wearer
 who wears robes that are worn thin[11]  then his fellow Brahma-farers
 do not revere, esteem, venerate, honour him.

 What is the cause of this?
 It is that these see
 and also hear
 of this reverend one
 that his occupations with evil unskilled wishes
 are not destroyed.

 Your reverence,
 it is like a bronze bowl
 brought back from a shop or smithy
 quite pure,
 quite clean;
 its owners, having filled it with a dead snake
 or a dead dog
 or a dead human being,
 and having enclosed it in another bronze bowl,
 might take it back inside the shop.

 People, on seeing it, would say:

 'Just look,
 what is this that has been brought back
 like a very lovely thing?'

 Having lifted it up and opened it,
 they would look at it;
 at the sight of it,
 repugnance would set in
 and loathing would set in
 and disgust would set in;
 those who had been hungry
 would have no desire for food,
 far less those who had eaten already
 even so, your reverence,
 of whatever monk it is seen and heard
 that these occupations with evil unskilled wishes
 are not destroyed  even though he be a forest-dweller
 whose lodgings are remote,
 one who walks for almsfood
 on continuous almsround,
 a rag-robe wearer
 who wears robes that are worn thin  then his fellow Brahma-farers do not revere,
 esteem, venerate, honour him.

 What is the cause of this?

 This reverend one's occupations
 with evil unskilled, wishes
 are seen as well as heard
 to be not destroyed.

 In whatever monk, your reverence, these occupations
 with evil unskilled wishes
 are seen and are heard
 to be destroyed  even though he were staying near a village,
 were one who is invited,[12]
 were one who wears householder's robe-material[13]  then his fellow Brahma-farers
 would revere, esteem, venerate, honour him.

 What is the cause of this?

 It is that these see and also hear
 of that reverend one
 that his occupations
 with evil unskilled wishes
 are destroyed.
 Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,
 brought back from a shop or smithy
 quite pure, quite clean.

 Its owners,
 having filled it with fine rice;
 rice-water,
 the black grains removed,
 with various curries,
 various vegetables,
 and having enclosed it in another bronze bowl,
 might take it back inside the shop.

 People, seeing it, would say:

 'Just look,
 what is this that has been brought back
 like a very lovely thing?

 Having lifted it up,
 having opened it,
 they would look at it.

 On seeing it,
 liking would set in,
 and no loathing would set in
 and no disgust would set in;
 even those who had eaten
 would have a desire for food,
 how much more those who were hungry?
 even so, your reverence,
 of whatever monk it is seen and heard that these occupations
 with evil unskilled wishes
 are destroyed  even though he were staying near a village,
 were one who is invited,
 were one who wears householder's robe-material  then his fellow Brahma-farers would revere
 would revere, esteem, venerate, honour him.

 What is the cause of this?

 It is that these see and also hear
 of this reverend one
 that his occupations
 with evil unskilled wishes
 are destroyed."

 When this had been said, the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:

 "A simile occurs[14] to me, reverend Sāriputta."

 "Let it be evident,[15] reverend Moggallāna."

 "Once I, your reverence,
 was staying near Rājagaha in the mountain Cowpen.[16]

 Then I, your reverence,
 having dressed in the morning,
 taking my bowl and robe,
 entered Rājagaha for alms-food.

 Now at that time Samīti,
 the son of a vehicle maker,
 was shaping a felloe,
 and the Naked Ascetic, Paṇḍu's son,
 who had formerly been the son of a vehicle maker,
 was standing near him.

 Then, your reverence,
 this reasoning arose in the mind of the Naked Ascetic,[17] Pandu's son, who had formerly been the son of a vehicle maker:
 'O that this Samīti,
 the son of a vehicle maker,
 might shape away this felloe's crookedness,
 its twist and notch,
 so that the felloe,
 without crookedness,
 without twist,
 without notch,
 might be clear and placed on the pith.'

 Even while there was this reasoning
 in the mind of the Naked Ascetic, Pandu's son,
 who had formerly been a vehicle maker,
 so did Samīti, the son of a vehicle maker,
 shape away that crookedness
 and that twist
 and that notch from the felloe.

 Then, your reverence,
 the Naked Ascetic, Paṇḍu's son,
 who had formerly been the son of a vehicle maker,
 was delighted;
 he let forth a cry of delight:

 'It seems as if he is shaping it away
 because with his heart[18] he knows my heart.'

 Even so, your reverence,
 those persons who are without faith,
 but who, in want of a way of living,
 have gone forth from home into homelessness,
 not from faith,
 who are crafty,
 fraudulent,
 deceitful,
 who are unbalanced[19] and puffed up,
 who are shifty,
 scurrilous
 and of loose talk,
 the doors of whose sense-faculties are not guarded,
 who do not know moderation in eating,
 who are not intent on vigilance,
 indifferent to recluse-ship,
 not of keen respect for the training,
 ones for abundance,
 lax,
 taking the lead in backsliding,
 shirking the burden of seclusion[20] who are indolent,
 of feeble energy,
 of confused mindfulness,
 not clearly conscious,
 not concentrated
 but of wandering minds,
 who are weak in wisdom,
 drivellers[21]  it seems that the venerable Sāriputta,
 because he knows their hearts with his heart,
 is shaping them
 by means of this disquisition on dhamma.

 But those young men of respectable families who,
 from faith,
 have gone forth from home into homelessness,
 who are not crafty,
 fraudulent
 or deceitful,
 who are not unbalanced,
 not puffed up,
 not shifty,
 not scurrilous
 or of loose talk,
 the doors of whose sense-faculties are guarded,
 who know moderation in eating,
 who are intent on vigilance,
 who long for recluseship,
 who are of keen respect for the training,
 not ones for abundance,
 not lax,
 shirking back-sliding,
 taking the lead in seclusion,
 who are of stirred up energy,
 self-resolute,
 with mindfulness aroused,
 clearly conscious,
 who are concentrated,
 their minds one-pointed,
 who have wisdom,
 are not drivellers  these, having heard this disquisition on dhamma
 from the venerable Sāriputta,
 seem to drink it,
 seem to savour it with speech
 as well as with mind.

 Indeed it is good that a fellow Brahma-farer,
 having caused one to rise up from[22] what is unskilled,
 establishes him in what is skilled.

 Your reverence,
 it is like[23] a woman or a man,
 young and of tender years,
 fond of adornment,
 who, having washed the head,
 having acquired a garland of lotuses
 or a garland of jasmine
 or a garland of acacia creeper,
 and having taken it in both hands
 should place it on the top of the head even so, your reverence,
 those young men of respectable families
 who have gone forth from home into homelessness from faith,
 who are not crafty,
 fraudulent
 or deceitful,
 who are not unbalanced,
 not puffed up,
 not shifty,
 not scurrilous
 or of loose talk,
 the doors of whose sense-faculties are guarded,
 who know moderation in eating,
 who are intent on vigilance,
 who long for recluseship,
 who are of keen respect for the training,
 not ones for abundance,
 not lax,
 shirking back-sliding,
 taking the lead in seclusion,
 who are of stirred up energy,
 self-resolute,
 with mindfulness aroused,
 clearly conscious,
 who are concentrated,
 their minds one-pointed,
 who have wisdom,
 are not drivellers  having heard this disquisition on dhamma from the venerable Sāriputta,
 seem to drink it,
 seem to savour it with speech
 as well as with mind.

 Indeed it is good that a fellow Brahma-farer,
 having caused one to rise up from what is unskilled,
 establishes him in what is skilled."
 In this wise did each of these great beings[24]rejoice together in what was well spoken by the other.
