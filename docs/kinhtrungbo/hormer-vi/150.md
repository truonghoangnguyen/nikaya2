# 150. Discourse to the People of Nagaravinda

## Nagara-Vindeyya Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time, the Lord,
 walking on tour among the Kosalans
 together with a large Order of monks,
 arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.

 The brahman householders of Nagaravinda heard it said that

 "Indeed, the recluse Gotama,
 gone forth from the Sakyan clan,
 and walking on tour among the Kosalans
 together with a large Order of monks,
 has arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.

 A lovely reputation concerning the recluse Gotama has gone abroad thus:
 'He is indeed Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,
 Well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and mankind,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.

 Having realised through his own super-knowledge,
 he makes known this world
 together with devas
 including the Māras and the Brahmās;
 creatures
 together with recluses and brahmans,
 with devas and mankind.

 He teaches dhamma
 that is lovely at the beginning,
 lovely in the middle
 and lovely at the ending;
 he explains with the spirit and the letter
 the Brahma-faring
 completely fulfilled
 and wholly purified.

 Good indeed is the sight
 of perfected ones such as this."

 Then the brahman householders of Nagaravinda
 approached the Lord;
 having approached him,
 some exchanged greetings with the Lord
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 they sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, having informed [340] the Lord of their names and clans,
 sat down at a respectful distance;
 some, becoming silent,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus
 to the brahman householders of Nagaravinda
 as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "If, householders,
 wanderers belonging to other sects
 should question you thus:

 'Householders,
 what kind of recluses and brahmans
 should not be revered,
 reverenced,
 esteemed
 or honoured?'

 you, householders,
 being questioned thus,
 could answer thus:

 'Those recluses and brahmans
 who are not devoid of attachment,
 not devoid of aversion,
 not devoid of confusion
 in regard to material shapes cognisable by the eye,
 whose minds are not inwardly tranquillised,
 who fare along now evenly,
 now unevenly[1]
 in body,
 speech
 and thought  recluses and brahmans such as these
 are not to be revered,
 reverenced,
 esteemed
 or honoured.

 What is the reason for this?

 It is that while[2] we,
 who are not devoid of attachment,
 not devoid of aversion,
 not devoid of confusion
 in regard to material shapes cognisable by the eye,
 our minds not inwardly tranquillised,
 fare along now evenly,
 now unevenly in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 it is yet not seen by them
 that this even-faring of ours
 is the higher.

 Therefore these worthy recluses and brahmans
 are not to be revered,
 reverenced,
 esteemed
 or honoured.

 If you, householders, are questioned thus,
 you could answer those wanderers belonging to other sects thus.
 If, householders, wanderers belonging to other sects
 should question you thus:

 'But what grounds do the venerable ones[4] have,
 what is the authority
 by which you, venerable ones, should speak thus:

 Certainly, those venerable ones
 are either devoid of attachment
 or are practising for the driving out of attachment,
 they are either devoid of aversion
 or are practising for the driving [342] out of aversion;
 they are either devoid of confusion
 or are practising for the driving out of confusion.'

 If you are questioned thus, householders,
 you could answer these wanderers belonging to other sects thus:

 'Those venerable ones
 frequent remote lodgings in lonely forest glades.

 But there are not there
 material shapes cognisable by the eye,
 sounds cognisable by the ear,
 smells cognisable by the nose,
 tastes cognisable by the tongue,
 touches cognisable by the body[5]
 such as having been seen,
 heard,
 smelt,
 tasted
 or touched
 over and over again,
 could delight them.
 These, your reverences, are the grounds,
 this is the authority
 by which we, venerable ones, speak thus:

 Certainly, those venerable ones
 are either devoid of attachment
 or are practising for the driving out of attachment,
 they are either devoid of aversion
 or are practising for the driving out of aversion;
 they are either devoid of confusion
 or are practising for the driving out of confusion.'

 If you, householders, are questioned thus,
 you could answer those wanderers belonging to other sects thus."

 When this had been said,
 the brahman householders of Nagaravinda
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "It is excellent, good Gotama,
 it is excellent, good Gotama.

 It is as if, good Gotama,
 one might set upright what had been upset,
 or might disclose what was covered,
 or point out the way
 to one who had gone astray,
 or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness
 so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so is dhamma made clear
 in many a figure by the good Gotama.

 We are going to the revered Gotama for refuge,
 and to dhamma
 and to the Order of monks.
 May the revered Gotama accept us
 as a lay-follower,
 going for refuge from this day forth
 for as long as life lasts."
