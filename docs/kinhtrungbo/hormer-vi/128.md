# 128. The Discourse on Defilements

## Upakkilesa Sutta

#### Thus have I heard:[1]

 At one time the Lord was staying near Kosambī
 in Ghosita's monastery.

 Now at that time the monks of Kosambī,
 who were disputatious,
 quarrelsome
 and contentious,
 lived wounding one another
 with the weapons of the tongue.[2]

 Then a certain monk approached the Lord;

 [153] having approached and greeted the Lord,
 he stood at a respectful distance.
 As he was standing at a respectful [198] distance, this monk spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, the monks of Kosambī,
 who are disputatious,
 quarrelsome
 and contentious,
 live wounding one another
 with the weapons of the tongue.

 It would be good, revered sir, if the Lord
 out of compassion
 were to approach these monks."

 The Lord consented by becoming silent.

 Then the Lord approached those monks
 and having approached,
 he spoke thus to those monks:

 "Enough, monks;
 no disputes,
 no quarrels,
 no contention,
 no argument."

 When this had been said,
 a certain monk[3] spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, let the Lord,
 the Dhamma-master, wait;
 revered sir, let the Lord,
 untroubled,
 abide intent
 on abiding in ease here and now,[4]
 for it is we who will be (held) accountable
 for this dispute,
 quarrel,
 contention
 and argument."

 ■

 And a second time the Lord spoke thus to those monks:

 "Enough, monks;
 no disputes,
 no quarrels,
 no contention,
 no argument."

 And a second time did that monk speak thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, let the Lord,
 the Dhamma-master, wait;
 revered sir, let the Lord,
 untroubled,
 abide intent
 on abiding in ease here and now,
 for it is we who will be (held) accountable
 for this dispute,
 quarrel,
 contention
 and argument."

 And a third time the Lord spoke thus to those monks:

 "Enough, monks;
 no disputes,
 no quarrels,
 no contention,
 no argument."

 And a third time did that monk speak thus to the Lord:
 "Revered sir, let the Lord,
 the Dhamma-master, wait;
 revered sir, let the Lord,
 untroubled,
 abide intent
 on abiding in ease here and now,
 for it is we who will be (held) accountable
 for this dispute,
 quarrel,
 contention
 and argument."

 Then the Lord,[5]
 having dressed early in the morning,
 taking his bowl and robe,
 entered Kosambī for almsfood.

 Having walked in Kosambī for almsfood
 and returning from the alms-gathering
 after the meal,
 he packed away his lodging
 and, taking his bowl and robe,
 spoke these verses as he was standing:

 [154]"When all in chorus bawl, none feels a fool,
 nor though the Order is divided, thinks otherwise.

 With wandering wits the wiseacres range all the field of talk;
 with mouths agape to full extent, what leads them on they know not.

 They who (in thought) belabour this: That man
 has me abused, has hurt, has worsted me,
 has me despoiled: in these wrath's not allayed.

 They who do not belabour this: That man
 has me abused, has hurt, has worsted me,
 has me despoiled: in them is wrath allayed.

 [199] Nay, not by wrath are wrathful moods allayed here (and) at any time,
 but by not-wrath are they allayed: this is an (ageless) endless rule.

 Some others don't discern that here we straitened are (in life, in time),
 but those who do discern, thereby their quarrels are allayed.

 Ruffians who maim and kill, steal cattle, steeds,
 and wealth, who plunder realms - for these is concord.
 Why should there not be for you?

 If one find friend with whom to fare
 Rapt in the well-abiding, apt,
 surmounting dangers one and all,
 with joy fare with him mindfully.

 Finding none apt with whom to fare,
 none in the well-abiding rapt,
 as rajah quits the conquered realm,
 fare lonely as bull-elephant in elephant-jungle.

 Better the faring of one alone
 than companionship with the foolish;
 fare lonely, unconcerned, working no evil,
 as bull-elephant in elephant-jungle."

 Then the Lord, having spoken these verses
 as he was standing,
 approached Bālakaloṇakāra village.

 Now at that [155] time
 the venerable Bhagu was staying in Bālakaloṇakāra village.

 Then the venerable Bhagu
 saw the Lord coming from afar;
 seeing him,
 he made ready a seat
 and water for the feet.

 The Lord sat down on the seat made ready,
 and as he was sitting down
 he bathed his feet.

 Then the venerable Bhagu,
 having greeted the Lord,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus
 to the venerable Bhagu
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "I hope, monk,
 things are going well with you,
 I hope you are keeping going,
 I hope you are not short of almsfood?"

 "Things are going well with me, Lord,
 I am keeping going, Lord,
 and I, revered sir,
 am not short of almsfood."

 Then the Lord, [200]
 having delighted,
 rejoiced,
 roused,
 gladdened
 the venerable Bhagu with talk on dhamma,
 rising from his seat,
 approached the Eastern Bamboo Grove.

 Now at that time[6] the venerable Anuruddha
 and the venerable Nandiya
 and the venerable Kimbila
 were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove.

 The keeper of the grove
 saw the Lord coming in the distance,
 and seeing him
 he spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Do not, recluse,
 enter this grove;
 there are three young men of family staying here
 desiring Self;
 do not cause them discomfort."

 But the venerable Anuruddha
 heard the keeper of the grove
 conferring with the Lord;
 on hearing him,
 he spoke thus to the keeper of the grove:

 "Do not, good grove-keeper,
 impede the Lord.

 It is our Teacher,
 the Lord,
 who is arriving."

 Then the venerable Anuruddha
 approached the venerable Nandiya
 and the venerable Kimbila,
 and having approached
 he spoke thus to the venerable Nandiya
 and the venerable Kimbila:

 "Go forward, venerable ones,
 go forward, venerable ones,
 our Teacher,
 the Lord,
 is arriving."

 Then the venerable Anuruddha
 and the venerable Nandiya
 and the venerable Kimbila,
 went out to meet the Lord.

 One received his bowl and robe,
 one made ready a seat,
 one set out water for the feet.

 Then the Lord sat down
 on the seat made ready;
 as he was sitting down
 the Lord bathed his feet.

 Then these venerable ones,
 having greeted the Lord,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 As the venerable Anuruddha
 was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the Lord spoke thus:

 "I hope things are going well with you, Anuruddhas,[7]
 I hope you are keeping going,
 I hope you are not short of almsfood?

 [156] "Things are going well with us, Lord,
 we are keeping going, Lord,
 and, revered sir,
 we are not short of almsfood."

 "I hope that you, Anuruddhas,
 are living all together
 on friendly terms
 and harmoniously,
 as milk and water blend,
 regarding one another
 with the eye of affection?"

 "Yes, certainly, revered sir,
 we are living all together
 on friendly terms
 and harmoniously,
 as milk and water blend,
 regarding one another
 with the eye of affection."

 "And how is it that you, Anuruddhas,
 are living all together
 on friendly terms
 and harmoniously,
 as milk and water blend,
 regarding one another
 with the eye of affection?"

 "As to this, revered sir,
 it occurred to me:

 'Indeed it is a gain for [201] me,
 indeed it is well gotten by me,
 that I am living with such fellow Brahma-farers.'

 On account of this, revered sir,
 for these venerable ones
 friendliness as to acts of body
 friendliness as to acts of speech
 friendliness as to acts of thought,
 whether openly or in private,
 has risen up in me.
 Because of this, revered sir,
 it occurred to me:

 'Now, suppose that I,
 having surrendered my own mind,
 should live only according to the mind
 of these venerable ones?

 So I, revered sir,
 having surrendered my own mind,
 am living only according to the mind
 of these venerable ones.

 Revered sir, we have divers bodies,
 but assuredly only one mind."

 ■

 And the venerable Nandiya too
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "As to this, revered sir,
 it occurred to me:

 'Indeed it is a gain for me,
 indeed it is well gotten by me,
 that I am living with such fellow Brahma-farers.'

 On account of this, revered sir,
 for these venerable ones
 friendliness as to acts of body
 friendliness as to acts of speech
 friendliness as to acts of thought,
 whether openly or in private,
 has risen up in me.
 Because of this, revered sir,
 it occurred to me:

 'Now, suppose that I,
 having surrendered my own mind,
 should live only according to the mind
 of these venerable ones?

 So I, revered sir,
 having surrendered my own mind,
 am living only according to the mind
 of these venerable ones.

 Revered sir, we have divers bodies,
 but assuredly only one mind."

 ■

 And the venerable Kimbila too
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "As to this, revered sir,
 it occurred to me:

 'Indeed it is a gain for me,
 indeed it is well gotten by me,
 that I am living with such fellow Brahma-farers.'

 On account of this, revered sir,
 for these venerable ones
 friendliness as to acts of body
 friendliness as to acts of speech
 friendliness as to acts of thought,
 whether openly or in private,
 has risen up in me.
 Because of this, revered sir,
 it occurred to me:

 'Now, suppose that I,
 having surrendered my own mind,
 should live only according to the mind
 of these venerable ones?

 So I, revered sir,
 having surrendered my own mind,
 am living only according to the mind
 of these venerable ones.

 Revered sir, we have divers bodies,
 but assuredly only one mind."

 "Thus it is that we, revered sir,
 are living all together
 on friendly terms
 and harmoniously,
 as milk and water blend,
 regarding one another
 with the eye of affection."

 "Good, it is good, Anuruddhas.

 But I hope that you, Anuruddhas,
 are living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute?"
 [157] "Yes, certainly, revered sir,
 we are living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute."

 "And how is it that you, Anuruddhas,
 are living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute?"

 "As to this, revered sir,
 whoever of us returns first
 from (going to) a village for almsfood
 makes ready a seat,
 sets out water for drinking and water for washing (the feet), and sets out a refuse-bowl.

 Whoever returns last
 from (going to) a village for almsfood,
 if there are the remains of a meal
 and if he so desires,
 he eats them;
 if he does not desire to do so,
 he throws them out
 where there are no crops,
 or he drops them into water
 where there are no living creatures;
 he puts up the seat,
 he puts away the water for drinking
 and the water for washing,
 he puts away the refuse-bowl,
 he sweeps the refectory.

 Whoever sees a vessel for drinking-water
 or a vessel for washing-water
 or a vessel (for water) for rinsing after evacuation,
 void and empty,
 he sets out (water).

 If it is impossible for him (to do this)
 by a movement of his hand,
 having invited a companion to help us
 by signalling (to him) with the hand,
 we set out (the water);
 but we do not, revered sir,
 for such a reason,
 break into speech.

 And then we, revered sir,
 once in every five nights
 sit down together for talk on dhamma.

 It is thus, revered sir,
 that we are living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute."[8]

 [202] "Good, it is good, Anuruddhas.

 But have you, Anuruddhas,
 while living thus diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 attained states of further-men,
 the excellent knowledge and insight
 befitting the ariyans,
 an abiding in comfort?"[9]
 "As to this, we, revered sir,
 while living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceive the light-manifestation[10]
 as well as the appearance[11] of material shapes.[12]

 But soon the light-manifestation vanishes for us
 as well as the appearance of material shapes;
 and we do not understand the reason."[13]

 ■

 "But the reason
 should be understood by you, Anuruddhas.

 I, too, Anuruddhas,
 before the Self-Awakening
 while I was yet the Bodhisatta,
 not fully awakened,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 But soon the light-manifestation [158] vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Doubt has arisen in me;
 and because there was [203] doubt,
 concentration fell away from[14] me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Lack of proper attention[15]
 has arisen in me;
 and because there was lack of proper attention,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.
 So I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Sloth and torpor has arisen in me;
 and because there was sloth and torpor,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor.'
 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Consternation has arisen in me;
 and because there was consternation,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.'

 Anuruddhas, it is as though a man were going along a high road
 and murderers should jump out at him
 from both sides;
 consternation would arise in him
 from such a source.[16]

 Even so, Anuruddhas, did consternation arise in me,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I thought:

 'I will act [159] in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack [204]of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Elation[17] has arisen in me;
 and because there was elation,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.
 Anuruddhas, it is as though a man
 who was seeking for one opening
 to (some hidden) treasure
 were to come at one and the same time
 on five openings to the treasure;[18]
 from that source
 elation would arise in him.

 Even so, Anuruddhas,
 elation arose in me;
 and because there was elation,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I thought:

 'I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:
 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Distress has arisen in me;
 and because there was distress,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation
 nor distress.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Too much energy[19] has arisen in me;
 and because there was too much energy,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, it is as though a man
 were to take such a tight grip of a quail
 that it died then and there.

 Even so, Anuruddhas,
 did too much energy arise in me;
 and because there was too much energy,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I thought:

 'I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation
 nor distress
 nor too much energy.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Too feeble an energy [160] has arisen in me;
 and because there was too feeble an energy;
 and because there was too much energy,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, it is as though a man
 were to take such a loose [205] grip of a quail
 that it could fly up out of his hand.

 Even so, Anuruddhas, did too feeble an energy arise in me;
 and because there was too feeble an energy,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.
 So I thought:

 'I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation
 nor distress
 nor too much energy
 nor too feeble an energy.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Longing[20] has arisen in me;
 and because there was longing,
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I thought:

 'I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation
 nor distress
 nor too much energy
 nor too feeble an energy
 nor longing.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:
 'Perception of diversity has arisen in me;
 and because there was perception of diversity;
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I thought:

 'I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation
 nor distress
 nor too much energy
 nor too feeble an energy
 nor longing
 nor perception of diversity.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 as well as the appear-ance of material shapes.

 ■

 But soon the light-manifestation vanished for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'Now what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that the light-manifestation vanishes for me
 as well as the appearance of material shapes?'

 Anuruddhas, this occurred to me:

 'A state of being too intent on material shapes has arisen in me;
 and because there was a state of being too intent on material shapes;
 concentration fell away from me;
 when concentration falls away,
 the light-manifestation vanishes
 as well as the appearance of material shapes.

 So I thought:

 'I will act in such a way
 that doubt will not arise in me again
 nor lack of proper attention
 nor sloth and torpor
 nor consternation
 nor elation
 nor distress
 nor too much energy
 nor too feeble an energy
 nor longing
 nor perception of diversity
 nor the state of being too intent on material shapes.'

 So I, Anuruddhas,
 knowing that doubt is a defilement of the mind,[21]
 got rid of the defilement of the mind that is doubt.

 Knowing that lack of proper attention
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is lack of proper attention.
 Knowing that sloth and torpor
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is sloth and torpor.

 Knowing that consternation
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is consternation.

 Knowing that elation
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is elation.

 Knowing that distress
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is distress.

 Knowing that too much [206] energy
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is too much energy.

 Knowing that too feeble an energy
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is too feeble an energy.

 Knowing that longing
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is longing.

 Knowing that perception of diversity
 is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is perception of diversity.

 Knowing that the state of being too intent on material shapes

 [161] is a defilement of the mind,
 I got rid of the defilement of the mind
 that is the state of being too intent on material shapes.

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 perceived the light-manifestation
 but did not see material shapes;
 then for a whole night
 and a whole day
 and a whole night and day
 I saw material shapes
 but did not perceive the light-manifestation.

 Concerning this, Anuruddhas,
 it occurred to me:

 'Now, what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that I perceived the light-manifestation
 but did not see material shapes;
 and then for a whole night
 and a whole day
 and a whole night and day
 I saw material shapes
 but did not perceive the light-manifestation?'

 Concerning this, Anuruddhas,
 it occurred to me:

 'It was at the time when I,
 not paying proper attention
 to the reflex-image of material shapes,[22]
 was paying attention
 to the reflex-image of the light-manifestation
 that I perceived the light-manifestation
 but did not see material shapes.

 But it was at the time when I,
 not paying proper attention
 to the reflex-image of the light-manifestation,
 was paying attention
 to the reflex-image of material shapes
 that, for a whole night
 and a whole day
 and a whole night and day,
 I saw material shapes
 but did not perceive the light-manifestation.'

 So I, Anuruddhas, living diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute,
 both perceived a limited light-manifestation[23]
 and saw a limited (number of) material shapes;
 and for a whole night
 and a whole day
 and a whole night and day
 I perceived a boundless light-manifestation
 and saw a boundless (number of) material shapes.

 Concerning this,
 it occurred to me, Anuruddhas:

 ' Now, what is the cause,
 what the reason
 that I both perceive a limited light-manifestation
 and see a limited (number of) material shapes
 as well as for a whole night
 and a whole day
 and a whole night and day
 perceive a boundless light-manifestation
 and see a boundless (number of) material shapes?'

 Concerning this,
 it occurred to me, Anuruddhas:

 'At the time when concentration is limited
 my vision is limited,
 so with limited vision [207]
 I both perceive a limited light-manifestation
 and see a limited (number of) material shapes.

 But at the time
 when my concentration is not limited
 my vision is boundless,
 so with boundless vision
 for a whole night
 and a whole day
 and a whole night and day
 I both perceive a boundless light-manifestation
 and see a boundless (number of) material shapes.'

 When [162] I knew, Anuruddhas,
 that doubt was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is doubt
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that lack of proper attention
 was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is lack of proper attention
 was got rid of.
 When I knew sloth and torpor was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is sloth and torpor
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that consternation was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is consternation
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that elation was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is elation
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that distress was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is distress
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that too much energy was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is too much energy
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that too feeble an energy was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is too feeble an energy
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that longing was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is longing
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that perception of diversity
 was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is perception of diversity
 was got rid of.

 When I knew that the state of being too intent on material shapes
 was a defilement of the mind,
 the defilement of the mind
 that is the state of being too intent on material shapes
 was got rid of.

 Concerning this, it occurred to me, Anuruddhas:

 'Those that were defilements of my mind
 are got rid of by me.

 Truly now
 I am developing concentration
 by three modes.'[24]

 So I, Anuruddhas,
 developed the concentration
 that has initial thought and discursive thought;
 and I developed the concentration
 that is without initial thought
 and has only discursive thought;[25]
 and I developed the concentration
 that is without initial thought
 and without discursive thought.

 And I developed the concentration
 that has rapture;[26]
 and [208] I developed the concentration
 that is without rapture;[27]
 and I developed the concentration
 that is accompanied by delight;[28]
 and I developed the concentration
 that is accompanied by equanimity.[29]

 When, Anuruddhas, there was developed in me
 the concentration
 that has initial and discursive thought,
 when there was developed the concentration
 that is without initial thought
 and has only discursive thought,
 when there was developed the concentration
 that is without initial thought
 and without discursive thought,
 and when there was developed the concentration
 that has rapture,
 and when there was developed the concentration
 that is without rapture,
 and when there was developed the concentration
 that is accompanied by delight,
 and when there was developed the concentration
 that is accompanied by equanimity,
 then the knowledge and vision arose in me:

 Unshakable is freedom of mind for me,
 this is the last birth,
 there is not now again-becoming."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Anuruddha
 rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
