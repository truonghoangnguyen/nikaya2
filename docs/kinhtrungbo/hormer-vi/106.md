# 106. Discourse on Beneficial Imperturbability

## Āṇañjasappāya Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Kuru people
 in the township of the Kurus called Kammāssadhamma.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Impermanent,[2] monks, are pleasures of the senses,
 hollow,[3]
 lying,[4]
 of the nature of falsehood;[5]
 this chatter of fools, monks,
 is made of illusion.

 Those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now[6]
 and those pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter,[7] and those
 perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter  both[8] are of Māra's realm;
 this is Māra's sphere,
 this is Māra's crop,[9]
 this is Māra's pasturage.[10]

 Here these evil unskilled intentions[11]
 conduce to covetousness
 and ill-will
 and destruction,
 and these create a stumbling-block here
 in the training of an ariyan disciple.

 As to this, monks,
 an ariyan disciple reflects thus:

 'Those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter, and those
 perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter  both are of Māra's realm;
 this is Māra's sphere,
 this is Māra's crop,
 this is Māra's pasturage.

 Here these evil unskilled intentions
 conduce to covetousness
 and ill-will
 and destruction,
 and these create a stumbling-block here
 in the training of an ariyan disciple.

 Suppose I were to abide
 with thought that is far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 with a determined[12] mind,
 having overcome the world.[13]

 For if I abide with my thought far-reaching,
 wide-spread,
 with my mind determined,
 having over- [47] come the world,
 these that are unskilled evil intentions:
 covetousness,
 ill-will
 and destruction,
 will not come to be;
 and by my getting rid of these
 my thought[14] will not be limited[15]
 (but) immeasurable,[16]
 well-developed.'[17]

 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;[18]
 if he is serene
 either he comes to imperturbability now
 or he is intent on wisdom.[19]
 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness[20]
 may accordingly[21] reach imperturbability.

 This, monks, is pointed to
 as the first course in beneficial imperturbability.

 And again, monks, an ariyan disciple reflects thus:[22]

 'There are those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions
 of pleasures of the senses that are here and now
 and those perceptions
 of pleasures of the senses that are hereafter,
 and whatever is material shape
 is material shape (consisting of) the four great elementals
 and derived from them.'

 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;
 if he is serene
 either he comes to imperturbability now[23]
 or he is intent on wisdom.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness
 may accordingly reach imperturbability.

 This, monks, is pointed to
 as the second course in beneficial imperturbability.

 And again, monks, an ariyan disciple reflects thus:[24]

 There [48] are those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those pleasures of the senses that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of material shapes
 that are hereafter;

 and those perceptions of material shapes that are here and now[25]
 and those perceptions of material shapes that are hereafter  both are impermanent.

 What is impermanent
 is not worth rejoicing over
 nor worth approval
 nor worth cleaving to.'
 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;
 if he is serene
 either he comes to imperturbability now[26]
 or he is intent on wisdom.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness
 may accordingly reach imperturbability.

 This, monks, is pointed to
 as the third course in beneficial imperturbability.

 And again, monks, an ariyan disciple reflects thus:[27]

 There are those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those pleasures of the senses that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of imperturbability  where all those perceptions are stopped without remainder,
 that is the real,
 that the excellent,[28]
 that is to say the plane of no-thing.'

 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;
 if he is serene
 either he comes to the plane of no-thing now
 or he is intent on wisdom.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness
 may accordingly reach the plane of no-thing.

 This, monks, is pointed to
 as the first course for the beneficial plane of no-thing.

 And again, monks, an ariyan disciple,
 forest-gone
 or gone to the root of a tree,
 reflects thus:[29]

 'Empty[30] is this of self
 or of what belongs to self.'[31]

 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;
 if he is serene
 either he comes to the plane of no-thing now
 or he is intent on wisdom.

 At the breaking [49] up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness
 may accordingly reach the plane of no-thing.

 This, monks, is pointed to
 as the second course for the beneficial plane of no-thing.

 And again, monks, an ariyan disciple reflects thus:[32]

 'I am naught of anyone
 anywhere
 nor is there anywhere
 aught of mine.'[33]

 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;
 if he is serene
 either he comes to the plane of no-thing now
 or he is intent on wisdom.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness
 may accordingly reach the plane of no-thing.
 This, monks, is pointed to
 as the third course for the beneficial plane of no-thing.

 And again, monks, an ariyan disciple reflects thus :[34]

 There are those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those pleasures of the senses that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of imperturbability,
 and there are those perceptions of the plane of no-thing  where all those perceptions are stopped without remainder,
 that is the real,
 that the excellent,
 that is to say the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'

 While he is faring along thus,
 abiding given over to this,
 his thought is peaceful in its sphere;
 if he is serene
 either he comes to the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception now
 or he is intent on wisdom.

 At the breaking up of the body after dying
 this situation exists,
 that that evolving consciousness
 may accordingly reach the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

 This; monks, is pointed to
 as the course for the beneficial plane of neither-perception-nor-non- perception."

 When this had been said
 the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, if a monk is here faring along thus and thinks:

 'Had it not been
 it would not be mine;
 if it be not
 it will not be mine;[35]
 I am getting rid of what is,
 of what has come to be'
 he is [50] thus acquiring equanimity.[36]

 Has not this monk, revered sir,
 attained final nibbāna?"

 "It may be, Ānanda, that some monk here
 attains final nibbāna.
 It may be that another monk here
 does not attain final nibbāna."

 "What is the cause, revered sir,
 what the reason
 that some monk here
 may attain final nibbāna,
 but that some other monk here
 may not attain final nibbāna?"[37]

 "As to this, Ānanda,
 if a monk is here
 faring along thus
 and thinks:

 'Had it not been
 it would not be mine;
 if it be not
 it will not be mine;
 I am getting rid of what is,
 of what has come to be'
 he is thus acquiring equanimity.

 He rejoices in this equanimity,
 approves of it
 and cleaves to it.

 While he rejoices in this equanimity,
 approves of it
 and cleaves to it,
 consciousness is dependent on it,
 grasping after it.

 A monk who has grasping, Ānanda,
 does not attain final nibbāna."[38]
 "But where,[39] revered sir,
 does a monk grasp
 who is grasping?"[40]

 "The plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, Ānanda."

 "Indeed, revered sir,
 the monk who is grasping
 grasps after the best of graspings."[41]

 "That monk who is grasping
 grasps after the best of graspings,
 Ānanda.

 For this is the best of graspings, Ānanda,
 that is to say
 the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

 Ānanda, if a monk is here faring along thus[42]
 and thinks:

 'Had it not been
 it would not be mine;
 if it be not
 it will not be mine;
 I am getting rid of what is,
 of what has come to be'
 he is thus acquiring equanimity.

 He does not rejoice in that equanimity,
 does not approve of it
 or cleave to it.

 Not rejoicing in that equanimity,
 not approving of it
 or cleaving to it,
 consciousness is not dependent on it,
 not grasping after it.

 A monk who is without grasping, Ānanda,
 attains final nibbāna."

 "It is wonderful, revered sir,
 it is marvellous, revered sir.

 Indeed it is by means of this and that,[43] revered sir,
 that the crossing of the [51] flood
 has been pointed out to us by the Lord.[44]

 But which, revered sir, is the ariyan Deliverance?"

 "As to this, Ānanda,
 an ariyan disciple[45] reflects thus:

 There are those pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those pleasures of the senses that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of pleasures of the senses
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of material shapes
 that are here and now
 and those perceptions of material shapes
 that are hereafter,
 and there are those perceptions of imperturbability,
 and there are those perceptions of the plane of no-thing,
 and there are those perceptions of the plane of neither-perception-nor-non perception  whatever is 'own body'
 this is 'own-body.'[46]

 But this is deathlessness,[47]
 that is to say the deliverance of thought without grasping.[48]

 So, Ānanda,
 taught by me has been the course for beneficial imperturbability,
 taught the course for the beneficial plane of no-thing,
 taught the course for the beneficial plane of neither-perception-nor-non- perception,
 taught by means of this and that
 has been the crossing of the flood,
 taught the ariyan Deliverance.

 Whatever, Ānanda, is to be done from compassion by a Teacher
 seeking the welfare of disciples,
 this has been done by me
 out of compassion for you.

 These, Ānanda,
 are the roots of trees,
 these are empty places.

 Meditate, Ānanda,
 be not slothful,
 be not remorseful later.

 This is our instruction to you."[49]

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
