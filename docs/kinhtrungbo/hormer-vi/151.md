# 151. Discourse on Complete Purity for Alms- Gathering

## Piṇḍapāta-Pārisuddhi Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha
 in the Bamboo Grove
 at the squirrels' feeding place.

 Then the venerable Sāriputta,
 emerging from solitary meditation towards [343] evening,
 approached the Lord; having approached and greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 2. "Your faculties are very bright, Sāriputta,
 your complexion very pure,
 very clear.

 In which abiding are you, Sāriputta,
 now abiding in the fullness thereof?"

 "Abiding in (the concept of) emptiness do I, revered sir,
 now abide in the fullness thereof."[1]

 "It is good, Sāriputta,
 it is good.

 You, Sāriputta, are now indeed abiding in fullness
 in the abiding of great men.[2]

 For this is the abiding of great men, Sāriputta,
 that is to say (the concept of) emptiness.

 3. Wherefore, Sāriputta, if a monk should desire:

 'May I now abide in fullness
 in the abiding in (the concept of) emptiness,'

 that monk should consider thus, Sāriputta:

 'On the road by which I entered the village for almsfood
 or in the part in which I walked for almsfood
 or on the road by which I left the village
 after (walking for) almsfood  did I have there in my mind
 desire or attachment
 or aversion or confusion
 or sensory reaction
 in regard to material shapes
 cognisable by the eye?

 If, Sāriputta, a monk while considering knows thus:
 'On the road by which I entered the village for almsfood
 or in the part in which I walked for almsfood
 or on the road by which I left the village
 after (walking for) almsfood  did I have there in my mind
 desire or attachment
 or aversion or confusion
 or sensory reaction
 in regard to material shapes
 cognisable by the eye'
 that monk, Sāriputta, should make an effort
 to get rid of these evil unskilled states themselves.

 But if, Sāriputta, a monk while considering knows thus:

 'On the road by which I entered the village for almsfood
 or in the part in which I walked for almsfood
 or on the road by which I left the village
 after (walking for) almsfood  did I have there in my mind
 desire or attachment
 or aversion or confusion
 or sensory reaction
 in regard to material shapes
 cognisable by the eye'
 that monk, Sāriputta, with rapture and joy
 can forsake[3] these,
 training himself day and night
 in states that are skilled.
 4. And again, Sāriputta, a monk should consider thus:

 'On the road by which I entered the village for almsfood
 or in the part in which I walked for almsfood
 or on the road by which I left the village
 after (walking for) almsfood  did I have there in my mind
 desire or attachment
 or aversion or confusion
 or sensory reaction
 in regard to sounds
 cognisable by the ear?'

 If, Sāriputta, a monk while considering knows thus:

 'On the road by which I entered the village for almsfood

 desire or attachment
 or aversion or confusion

 or aversion or confusion

 in regard to smells
 cognisable by the nose?'

 If, Sāriputta, a monk while considering knows thus:

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Sāriputta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
