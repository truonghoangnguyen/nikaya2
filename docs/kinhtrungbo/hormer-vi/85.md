# 85. Discourse to Prince Bodhi

## Bodhi-Rāja-Kumāra Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Bhaggas
 in Suṁsumāragira
 in Bhesakaḷā Grove
 in the deer-park.

 At that time Prince Bodhi had a palace named Kokanada;[1]
 it had not long been built
 and had had not (yet) been inhabited
 by a recluse
 or brahman
 or by any human being.

 Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,
 saying:
 "Come you, good Sañjikā's son,
 approach the Lord;
 having approached,
 in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head,
 and ask whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort,
 and say:

 'Lord, Prince Bodhi salutes the Lord's feet with his head
 and asks whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort.'

 And speak thus to him:

 'Revered sir, may the Lord,
 together with the Order of monks,
 consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow
 with Prince Bodhi.'"

 "Yes, sir,"
 and the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,
 having answered Prince Bodhi in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord,
 and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the brahman youth Sañjikā's son
 spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Good Gotama,
 Prince Bodhi salutes with his head
 the good Gotama's feet
 and asks whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort.

 And he speaks thus:

 'May the revered Gotama,
 together with the Order of monks,
 consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow
 with Prince Bodhi.'"

 The Lord consented by becoming silent.

 Then the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,
 having understood the Lord's consent,
 rising from his seat
 approached Prince Bodhi;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:

 "I spoke in your name, good sir,
 to the Lord Gotama,
 saying:

 "Good Gotama,
 Prince Bodhi salutes with his head
 the good Gotama's feet
 and asks whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort.

 And he speaks thus:

 'May the revered Gotama,
 together with the Order of monks,
 consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow
 with [280] Prince Bodhi.'"

 And the recluse Gotama consented."

 Then, after Prince Bodhi had had sumptuous foods,
 solid and soft,
 prepared in his own dwelling
 towards the end of that night,
 and had had the Kokanada palace
 spread with white cloths
 as far as the last[2] flight of stairs,
 he addressed the brahman youth Sanjikā's son,
 saying:

 "Come you, good Sañjikā's son,
 approach the Lord;
 having approached,
 announce the time to the Lord,
 saying:

 'It is time, revered sir,
 the meal is ready.'"

 "Yes, good sir,"
 and the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,
 having answered Prince Bodhi in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he announced the time to the Lord,
 saying:

 "It is time, revered sir,
 the meal is ready."

 Then the Lord, dressing in the morning
 and taking his bowl and robe,
 approached Prince Bodhi's dwelling.

 At that time Prince Bodhi,
 while he was waiting for the Lord,
 was standing at the porch
 of the outside gateway.

 And Prince Bodhi saw the Lord coming in the distance;
 having seen him
 and gone to meet him,
 he greeted and honoured the Lord
 and approached the Kokanada palace.

 Then the Lord stood
 leaning against the last flight of stairs.

 And Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths,
 let the Well-farer step on the cloths
 so that for a long time
 it may be for my welfare and happiness."

 When this had been said,
 the Lord was silent.

 And a second time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:
 "Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths,
 let the Well-farer step on the cloths
 so that for a long time
 it may be for my welfare and happiness."

 When this had been said,
 the Lord was silent.

 And a third time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths,
 let the Well-farer step on the cloths
 so that for a long time
 it may be for my welfare and happiness."

 Then the Lord looked towards the venerable Ānanda.

 And the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:

 "Prince, have the cloths packed away.

 The Lord will not tread upon a cloth carpeting;
 the Tathāgata looks towards[3] the folk that come after."

 Then Prince Bodhi had the cloths packed away,
 and had a seat made ready
 upstairs in the Kokanada palace.

 Then the Lord
 having ascended the Kokanada palace,
 sat down on the seat made ready
 together with the Order of monks.

 Then Prince Bodhi
 with his own hand
 served and satisfied the Order of monks
 with the Lord at its head
 with sumptuous foods,
 solid and soft.

 Then when the Lord had eaten
 and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl,
 Prince Bodhi, having taken a lower seat,
 sat down at a respectful distance.

 [281] As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 Prince Bodhi Spoke thus to the Lord:

 "Lord, it has occurred to me thus:

 Happiness is not to be achieved through happiness;
 happiness is to be achieved through suffering."[4]

 "To me too, Prince,
 before my Awakening,
 while I was still the bodhisatta,
 not fully awakened,
 it occurred:

 Happiness is not to be achieved through happiness;
 happiness is to be achieved through suffering."

 Then I, Prince, after a time, being young, my hair coal-black,
 possessed of radiant youth,
 in the prime of my life —
 although my unwilling parents wept and wailed —
 having cut off my hair and beard,
 having put on yellow robes,
 went forth from home
 into homelessness.

 I, being gone forth thus,
 a quester for whatever is good,
 searching for the incomparable,
 matchless path to peace,
 approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;
 having approached,
 I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:

 'I, reverend Kālāma, want to fare the Brahmā-faring
 in this dhamma and discipline.'

 This said, Prince, Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me:

 'Let the venerable one proceed;
 this dhamma is such that an intelligent man,
 having soon realised super-knowledge for himself
 (as learnt from) his own teacher,
 may enter on and abide in it.'

 So I, Prince, very soon,
 very quickly,
 mastered that dhamma.

 I, Prince, as far as mere lip service,
 mere repetition
 were concerned,
 spoke the doctrine of knowledge,
 and the doctrine of the elders,
 and I claimed —
 I as well as others —
 that 'I know, I see.'

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'But Āḷāra the Kālāma does not merely proclaim this dhamma
 simply out of faith:
 Having realised super-knowledge for myself,
 entering on it,
 I am abiding therein.
 For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing, seeing this dhamma.'

 Then did I, Prince,
 approach Āḷāra the Kālāma;
 having approached,
 I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:

 'To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma,
 having realised super-knowledge for yourself,
 entering thereon,
 proclaim this dhamma?'

 When this had been said, Prince, Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith,
 I too have faith.

 It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy,
 I too have energy.

 It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness,
 I too have mindfulness.

 It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration,
 I too have concentration.

 It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom,
 I too have intuitive wisdom.

 Suppose now that I should strive
 for the realisation of that dhamma
 which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims:
 'Having realised super-knowledge for myself,
 entering on it
 I am abiding therein?'

 So I, Prince, very soon,
 very quickly,
 having realised super-knowledge for myself,
 entering on that dhamma,
 abided therein.

 Then I, Prince,
 approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;
 having approached,
 I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:

 'Is it to this extent
 that you, reverend Kalama,
 proclaim this dhamma,
 entering on it,
 having realised it by your own super-knowledge?'

 'It is to this extent
 that I, your reverence,
 proclaim this dhamma,
 entering on it,
 having realised it by my own super-knowledge.'

 'I too, your reverence,
 having realised this dhamma
 by my own super-knowledge,
 entering on it
 am abiding in it.'

 'It is profitable for us,
 it is well gotten for us, your reverence,
 that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer
 such as the venerable one.
 This dhamma that I, entering on,
 proclaim,
 having realised it by my own super-knowledge,
 is the dhamma that you,
 entering on,
 are abiding in,
 having realised it by your own super-knowledge;
 the dhamma that you,
 entering on,
 are abiding in,
 having realised it by your own super-knowledge,
 is the dhamma that I,
 entering on,
 proclaim,
 having realised it by my own super-knowledge.

 The dhamma that I know,
 this is the dhamma that you know.

 The dhamma that you know,
 this is the dhamma that I know.

 As I am,
 so are you;
 as you are,
 so am I.

 Come now, your reverence,
 being just the two of us,
 let us look after this group.'

 In this way, Prince,
 did Āḷāra the Kālāma,
 being my teacher,
 set me — the pupil —
 on the same level as himself
 and honoured me with the highest honour.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard
 nor to dispassion
 nor to stopping
 nor to tranquillity
 nor to super-knowledge
 nor to awakening
 nor to Nibbāna,
 but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.'

 So I, Prince,
 not getting enough from this dhamma,
 disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.

 Then I, Prince,
 a quester for whatever is good,
 searching for the incomparable,
 matchless path to peace,
 approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;
 having approached,
 I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:

 'I, your reverence,
 want to fare the Brahmā-faring
 in this dhamma and discipline.'

 This said, Prince, Uddaka, Rāma's son,
 spoke thus to me:
 'Let the venerable one proceed;
 this dhamma is such
 that an intelligent man,
 having soon realised super-knowledge for himself,
 (as learnt from) his own teacher,
 may enter on and abide in it.'

 So I, Prince, very soon,
 very quickly,
 mastered that dhamma.

 I, Prince, as far as mere lip service,
 mere repetition were concerned,
 spoke the doctrine of knowledge
 and the doctrine of the elders,
 and I claimed —
 I as well as others —
 that 'I know, I see.'

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'But Uddahka, Rāma's son, does not merely proclaim this dhamma
 simply out of faith:
 Having realised super-knowledge for myself,
 entering on it,
 I am abiding in it.

 For surely Uddaka, Rāma's son,
 proceeds knowing and seeing this dhamma.'

 Then did I, Prince,
 approach Uddaka, Rāma's;
 having approached,
 I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:

 'To what extent do you, reverend Rāma,
 having realised super-knowledge for yourself,
 entering thereon
 proclaim this dhamma?'

 When this had been said, Prince, Uddahka, Rāma's son,
 proclaimed the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'It is not only Rāma who has faith,
 I too have faith.

 It is not only Rāma who has energy,
 I too have energy.

 It is not only Rāma who has mindfulness,
 I too have mindfulness.

 It is not only Rāma who has concentration,
 I too have concentration.

 It is not only Rāma who has intuitive wisdom,
 I too have intuitive wisdom.

 Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma
 which Rāma proclaims:
 'Having realised super-knowledge for myself,
 entering on it
 I am abiding in it?'

 So I, Prince, very soon,
 very quickly,
 having realised super-knowledge for myself,
 entering on that dhamma,
 abided therein.

 Then I, Prince,
 approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;
 having approached,
 I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:

 'Is it to this extent
 that you, reverend Rāma,
 proclaim this dhamma,
 entering on it,
 having realised it by your own super-knowledge?'

 'It is to this extent
 that I, your reverence,
 proclaim this dhamma,
 entering on it,
 having realised it by my own super-knowledge.'

 'I too, your reverence,
 having realised this dhamma by my own super-knowledge,
 entering on it
 am abiding in it.'

 'It is profitable for us,
 it is well gotten by us,
 your reverence,
 that we see a fellow-Brahmā-farer such as the venerable one.

 This dhamma that I,
 entering on,
 proclaim,
 having realised it by my own super-knowledge,
 is the dhamma that you,
 entering on,
 are abiding in,
 having realised it by your own super-knowledge;
 the dhamma that you,
 entering on,
 are abiding in,
 having realised it by your own super-knowledge,
 is the dhamma that I,
 entering on,
 proclaim,
 having realised it by my own super-knowledge.

 The dhamma that I know,
 this is the dhamma that you know.

 That dhamma that you know,
 this is the dhamma that I know.

 As I am,
 so are you;
 as you are,
 so am I.

 Come now, your reverence,
 being just the two of us,
 let us look after this group.

 In this way, Prince, did Uddaka, Rāma's son,
 being my teacher,
 set me — the pupil —
 on the same level as himself
 and honoured me with the highest honour.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard
 nor to dispassion
 nor to stopping
 nor to tranquillity
 nor to super-knowledge
 nor to awakening
 nor to Nibbāna,
 but only as far as reaching the plane of neither-perception-nor-non- perception.'

 So I, Prince, not getting enough from this dhamma,
 disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.

 Then I, monks, a quester for whatever is good,
 searching for the incomparable,
 matchless path to peace,
 walking on tour through Magadha
 in due course arrived at Uruvela,
 the camp township.

 There I saw a delightful stretch of land
 and a lovely woodland grove,
 and a clear flowing river
 with a delightful ford,
 and a village for support nearby.

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Indeed it it is a delightful stretch of land,
 and the woodland grove is lovely,
 and the river flows clear
 with a delightful ford,
 and there is a village for support nearby.

 Indeed this does well
 for the striving
 of a young man set on striving.'
 Moreover, Prince,
 three similes occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before:

 It is as if there were a wet sappy stick placed in water;
 then a man might come along
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,
 and thinking:

 'I will light a fire,
 I will get heat.'

 What do you think about this, Prince?

 Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,
 and rubbing that wet sappy stick
 that had been placed in water (with it),
 light a fire,
 could he get heat?"

 "No, good Gotama.

 What is the cause of this?

 It is, good Gotama,
 that such a stick is wet and sappy
 and that it was placed in water.

 That man would only get fatigue and distress."

 "In like manner, Prince,
 whatever recluses or brahmans dwell not aloof
 from pleasures of the senses that are bodily,
 then if that which is for them,
 among the sense-pleasures,
 desire for sense-pleasure,
 affection for sense-pleasure,
 infatuation with sense-pleasure,
 thirst for sense-pleasure,
 fever for sense-pleasure  if that is not properly got rid of subjectively
 nor properly allayed,
 whether these worthy recluses and brahmans experience feelings which are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe,
 they could not become those for knowledge,
 for vision,
 for the incomparable Self-awakening;
 and whether these worthy recluses and brahmans do not experience feelings which are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe,
 they could not become those for knowledge,
 for vision,
 for the incomparable Self-awakening.

 This, Prince, was the first parable
 that occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before.

 ■

 Then, Prince, a second parable
 occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before.

 It is as if, Prince, a wet, sappy stick
 were placed on dry ground,
 far from water.
 Then a man might come along
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,
 and thinking:

 'I will light a fire,
 I will get heat.'

 What do you think about this, Prince?

 Could that man,
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,
 and rubbing that wet sappy stick
 that had been placed on the dry ground,
 far from water,
 light a fire,
 could he get heat?"|| ||

 "No, good Gotama.

 What is the cause of this?

 It is, good Gotama, that that stick is wet and sappy
 although it had been placed on dry ground,
 far from water.

 So that man would only get fatigue and distress."

 "In like manner, Prince,
 whatever recluses or brahmans dwell not aloof
 from pleasures of the senses that are bodily,
 then if that which is for them,
 among the sense-pleasures,
 desire for sense-pleasure,
 affection for sense-pleasure,
 infatuation with sense-pleasure,
 thirst for sense-pleasure,
 fever for sense-pleasure if that is not properly got rid of subjectively
 nor properly allayed,
 whether these worthy recluses and brahmans experience feelings which are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe,
 they could not become those for knowledge,
 for vision,
 for the incomparable Self-awakeningi;
 and whether these worthy recluses and brahmans do not experience feelings which are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe,
 they could not become those for knowledge,
 for vision,
 for the incomparable Self-awakening.

 This, Prince, was the second parable
 that occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before.

 ■

 Then, Prince, a third parable
 occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before.

 It is as if, Prince, a dry sapless stick
 were placed on the dry ground,
 far from water.

 Then a man might come along
 bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,
 and thinking:
 'I will light a fire,
 I will get heat.'

 What do you think about this, Prince?

 Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,
 and rubbing that dry sapless stick
 that had been placed on dry ground,
 far from water,
 light a fire,
 could he get heat?"

 "Yes, good Gotama.

 What is the cause of this?

 It is, good Gotama,
 that that stick was dry and sapless
 and had been placed on dry ground
 far from water."

 "In like manner, Prince,
 whatever recluses or brahmans dwell aloof
 from pleasures of the senses that are bodily,
 then if that which is for them,
 among the sense-pleasures,
 desire for sense-pleasure,
 affection for sense-pleasure,
 infatuation with sense-pleasure,
 thirst for sense-pleasure,
 fever for sense-pleasure  if this is well got rid of subjectively,
 well allayed,
 then whether these worthy recluses and brahmans experience feelings that are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe,
 indeed they become those for knowledge,
 for vision,
 for the incomparable Self-awakening;
 and whether these worthy recluses and brahmans do not experience feelings that are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe,
 indeed they become those for knowledge,
 for vision,
 for the incomparable Self-awakening.

 This, Prince, was the third parable
 that occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before.

 These, Prince, were the three parables
 that occurred to me spontaneously,
 never heard before.

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose now that I,
 with my teeth clenched,
 with my tongue pressed against the palate,
 by mind should subdue,
 restrain and dominate my mind?'

 So I, Prince, with my teeth clenched,
 with my tongue pressed against the palate,
 by mind subdued,
 restrained
 and dominated my mind.

 While I was subduing,
 restraining
 and dominating my mind,
 with the teeth clenched,
 the tongue pressed against the palate,
 sweat poured from my armpits.

 It is as if, Prince,
 a strong man,
 having taken hold of a weaker man
 by his head or shoulders,
 would subdue,
 restrain
 and dominate him.

 Even so, while I, Prince,
 was subduing,
 restraining
 and dominating my mind by mind,
 with my teeth clenched,
 with my tongue pressed against the palate,
 sweat poured from my armpits.

 Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 yet my body was turbulent,
 not calmed,
 because I was harassed in striving
 by striving against that very pain.

 But yet, Prince,
 that painful feeling,
 arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.|| ||

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose now that I should meditate
 the non-breathing meditation?

 So I, Prince,
 stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose.

 When I, Prince,
 had stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose,
 there came to be an exceedingly loud noise
 of winds escaping by the auditory passages.

 As there comes to be an exceedingly loud noise
 from the roaring of a smith's bellows,
 even so when I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose,
 there came to be an exceedingly loud noise
 of wind escaping by the auditory passages.

 Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 yet my body was turbulent,
 not calmed,
 because I was harassed in striving
 by striving against that very pain.

 It was even in this wise, Prince,
 that a painful feeling that had arisen in me
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose now that I should still meditate
 the non-breathing meditation?'

 So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears.

 When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 exceedingly loud winds rent my head.

 As, Prince, a strong man
 might cleave one's head
 with a sharp-edged sword,
 even so when I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 exceedingly loud winds rent my head.

 Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 yet my body was turbulent,
 not calmed,
 because I was harassed in striving
 by striving against that very pain.

 But yet, Prince, that painful feeling,
 arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.
 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose that I should still meditate
 the non-breathing meditation?'

 So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears.

 When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 I came to have very bad headaches.

 As, Prince, a strong man
 might clamp a turban on one's head
 with a tight leather strap,
 even so when I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 did I come to have very bad headaches.

 Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 yet my body was turbulent,
 not calmed,
 because I was harassed in striving
 by striving against that very pain.

 But yet, Prince, that painful feeling,
 arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 It occurred to me, Prince:
 'Suppose now that I should still meditate
 the non-breathing meditation?'

 So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears.

 When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 very strong winds cut through my stomach.

 As, Prince, a skilled cattle-butcher
 or his apprentice
 might cut through the stomach
 with a sharp butcher's knife,
 even so, Prince, did very strong winds
 cut through my stomach.

 Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 yet my body was turbulent,
 not calmed,
 because I was harassed in striving
 by striving against that very pain.

 But yet, Prince, that painful feeling,
 arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose now that I should still meditate
 the non-breathing meditation?'
 So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears.

 When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 there came to be a fierce heat in my body.

 As, Prince, two strong men,
 having taken hold of a weaker man by his limbs,
 might set fire to him,
 might make him sizzle up
 over a charcoal pit,
 even so, Prince,
 when I had stopped breathing in and breathing out
 through the mouth
 and through the nose
 and through the ears,
 did there come to be a fierce heat in my body.

 Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me,
 unmuddled mindfulness set up,
 yet my body was turbulent,
 not calmed,
 because I was harassed in striving
 by striving against that very pain.

 But yet, Prince, that painful feeling,
 arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 In addition to this, Prince,
 devatās, having seen me, spoke thus:
 'The recluse Gotama has passed away.'

 Other devatās spoke thus;

 'The recluse Gotama has not passed away,
 but he is passing away.'

 Other devatās spoke thus:

 'The recluse Gotama has not passed away,
 nor is he passing away;
 the recluse Gotama is a perfected one,
 the mode of living of a perfected one
 is just like this.'

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose now that I should take the line
 of desisting from all food?'

 Then, Prince, devatās,
 having approached me,
 spoke thus:

 'Do not, good sir,
 take the line of desisting from all food.

 If you, good sir,
 take the line of desisting from all food,
 then we will give you deva-like essences
 to take in through the pores of the skin;
 you will keep going by means of them.'

 Then, Prince, it occurred to me:

 'Suppose that I should take the line
 of not eating anything,
 and these devatās were to give me deva-like essences
 to take in through the pores of the skin,
 and that I should keep going by means of them,
 that would be an imposture in me.'

 So I, Prince, rejected those devatās
 I said,
 'Enough.'

 It occurred to me, Prince:

 'Suppose now that I were to take food
 little by little,
 drop by drop,
 such as bean-soup
 or vetoh-soup
 or chick-pea-soup
 or pea-soup?

 So I, Prince, took food
 little by little,
 drop by drop,
 such as bean-soup
 or veteh-soup
 or chick-pea-soup
 or pea-soup.

 While I, Prince, was taking food
 little by little,
 drop by drop,
 such as bean-soup
 or vetch-soup
 or chick-pea-soup
 or pea-soup,
 my body became exceedingly emaciated.
 Because I ate so little,
 all my limbs became like the joints of withered creepers;
 because I ate so little,
 my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof;
 because I ate so little,
 my protruding backbone
 became like a string of balls;
 because I ate so little,
 my gaunt ribs
 became like the crazy rafters
 of a tumble-down shed;
 because I ate so little,
 the pupils of my eyes
 appeared lying low and deep;
 because I ate so little,
 my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk
 as a bitter white gourd
 cut before it is ripe
 becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind.

 If I, Prince, thought:

 'I will touch the skin of my belly,'
 it was my backbone that I took hold of.

 If I thought:

 'I will touch my backbone,'
 it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of.

 For because I ate so little,
 the skin of my belly, Prince,
 came to be cleaving to my backbone.

 If I, Prince, thought:
 'I will obey the calls of nature,'
 I fell down on my face then and there,
 because I ate so little.

 If I, Prince, soothing my body,
 stroked my limbs with my hand,
 the hairs,
 rotted at the roots,
 fell away from my body
 as I stroked my limbs with my hand,
 because I ate so little.

 And further, Prince, men,
 having seen me,
 spoke thus:

 'The recluse Gotama is black.'

 Other men spoke thus:

 'The recluse Gotama is not black,
 the recluse Gotama is deep brown.'

 Some men spoke thus:

 'The recluse Gotama is not black,
 he is not even deep brown,
 the recluse Gotama is of a sallow colour.'

 To such an extent, Prince,
 was my clear pure complexion
 spoilt because I ate so little.

 This, Prince, occurred to me:

 'Some recluses and brahmans
 in the past
 have experienced feelings that were acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe;
 but this is paramount,
 nor is there worse than this.

 And some recluses and brahmans
 in the future
 will experience feelings that are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe;
 but this is paramount,
 nor is there worse than this.

 And some recluses and brahmans
 are now
 experiencing feelings that are acute,
 painful,
 sharp,
 severe;
 but this is paramount,
 nor is there worse than this.

 But I,
 by this severe austerity,
 do not reach states of further-men,
 the excellent knowledge and vision
 befitting the ariyans.

 Could there be another way to awakening?

 This, Prince, occurred to me:

 'I know that while my father, the Sakyan,
 was ploughing,
 and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,
 aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 entering on the first meditation,
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful,
 and while abiding therein,
 I thought:

 'Now could this be a way to awakening?'

 Then, following on my mindfulness, Prince,
 there was the consciousness:

 'This is itself the Way to awakening.'

 This occurred to me, Prince:

 'Now, am I afraid of that happiness
 which is happiness
 apart from sense-pleasures,
 apart from unskilled states of mind?'

 This occurred to me, Prince:

 'I am not afraid of that happiness
 which is happiness
 apart from sense-pleasures,
 apart from unskilled states of mind.'

 This occurred to me, Prince:

 'Now it is not easy to reach that happiness
 by thus subjecting the body
 to extreme emaciation.
 Suppose I were to take material nourishment  boiled rice
 and sour milk?'

 So I, Prince, took material nourishment  boiled rice
 and sour milk.

 Now at that time, Prince,
 five monks were attending me
 and (they thought):

 'When the recluse Gotama wins dhamma
 he will announce it to us.'

 But when I, Prince, took material nourishment  boiled rice
 and sour milk  then these five monks turned on me in disgust,
 saying:

 'The recluse Gotama lives in abundance,
 he is wavering in his striving,
 he has reverted to a life of abundance.'

 But when I, Prince, had taken some material nourishment,
 having picked up strength,
 aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 I entered on
 and abided in
 the first meditation
 which is accompanied by initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 is born of aloofness,
 and is rapturous and joyful.
 But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 By allaying initial thought
 and discursive thought,
 with the mind subjectively tranquillised
 and fixed on one point,
 I entered on
 and abided in
 the second meditation
 which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,
 is born of concentration,
 and is rapturous and joyful.

 But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 By the fading out of rapture
 I dwelt with equanimity,
 attentive and clearly conscious,
 and I experienced in my person
 that joy of which the ariyans say:
 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'
 and I entered on
 and abided in
 the third meditation.

 But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 By getting rid of joy
 and by getting rid of anguish,
 by the going down of former pleasures and sorrows,
 I entered into
 and abided in
 the fourth meditation
 which has neither anguish nor joy
 and which is entirely purified
 by equanimity and mindfulness.

 But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,
 persisted without impinging on my mind.

 With the mind composed thus,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 fixed,
 immovable,
 I directed my mind
 to the knowledge and recollection
 of former habitations:

 I remembered a variety of former habitations, thus:
 one birth,
 two births,
 three births,
 four births,
 five births,
 ten births,
 twenty births,
 thirty births,
 forty births,
 fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 and many an eon of integration
 and many an eon of disintegration
 and many an eon of integration-disintegration;
 such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I arose here.

 Thus I remember divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail.

 This, Prince,
 was the first knowledge attained by me
 in the first watch of the night;
 ignorance was dispelled,
 knowledge arose,
 darkness was dispelled,
 light arose,
 even as I abided diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute.

 ■

 Then with the mind composed,
 quite purified,
 quite clarified,
 without blemish,
 without defilement,
 grown soft and workable,
 fixed,
 immovable,
 I directed my mind
 to the knowledge of the passing hence
 and the arising of beings.

 With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 I see beings as they pass hence
 or come to be;
 I comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going,
 according to the consequences of their deeds,
 and I think:

 Indeed these worthy beings
 who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,
 who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,
 scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 who were possessed of good conduct in speech,
 who were possessed of good conduct in thought,
 who did not scoff at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Thus with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 do I see beings as they pass hence,
 as they arise;
 I comprehend that beings are mean,
 excellent,
 comely,
 ugly,
 well-going,
 ill-going
 according to the consequences of their deeds.

 This, Prince,
 was the second knowledge attained by me
 in the middle watch of the night;
 ignorance was dispelled,
 knowledge arose,
 darkness was dispelled,
 light arose,
 even as I abided diligent,
 ardent,
 self-resolute.[5]

 ■

 Then Prince, it occurred to me:

 'This dhamma, won to by me
 is deep,
 difficult to see,
 difficult to understand,
 tranquil,
 excellent,
 beyond dialectic,
 subtle,
 intelligible to the learned.

 But this is a creation
 delighting in sensual pleasure,
 delighted by sensual pleasure,
 rejoicing in sensual pleasure.

 So that for a creation
 delighting in sensual pleasure,
 delighted by sensual pleasure,
 rejoicing in sensual pleasure,
 this were a matter difficult to see,
 that is to say
 causal uprising by way of condition.

 This too were a matter difficult to see,
 that is to say
 the tranquillising of all the activities,
 the renunciation of all attachment,
 the destruction of craving,
 dispassion,
 stopping,
 Nibbāna.

 But if I were to teach dhamma
 and others were not to understand me,
 that would be a weariness to me,
 that would be a vexation to me.

 Moreover, Prince, these verses
 not heard before in the past
 spontaneously occurred to me:

 This that through many toils I've won —
 Enough! why should I make it known?
 By folk with lust and hate consumed
 This dhamma is not understood.

 Leading on against the stream,
 Deep, subtle, difficult to see, delicate,
 Unseen 'twill be by passion's slaves
 Cloaked in the murk of ignorance.

 In such wise, as I was pondering, Prince,
 my mind inclined to little effort
 and not teaching dhamma.

 Then, Prince, it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati
 who knew with his mind
 the reasoning in my mind:

 'Alas, the world is lost,
 alas, the world is destroyed,
 inasmuch as the mind of the Tathāgata,
 the perfected one,
 the fully awakened one,
 inclines to little effort
 and not to teaching dhamma.'

 Then, Prince,
 as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,
 or might bend back his outstretched arm,
 even so did Brahmā Sahampati,
 vanishing from the Brahmā-world,
 become manifest before me.

 Then, Prince, Brahmā Sahampati,
 having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
 having saluted me with joined palms,
 spoke thus to me:

 'Lord, let the Lord teach dhamma,
 let the well-farer teach dhamma;
 there are beings with little dust in their eyes who;
 not hearing dhamma,
 are decaying,
 (but if) they are learners of dhamma
 they will grow.'

 Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati to me, Prince;
 having said this,
 he further spoke thus:

 'There has appeared in Magadha before thee
 An unclean dhamma by (minds) with stains devised.
 Open this door of deathlessness; let them hear
 Dhamma awakened to by the stainless one.

 As on a crag on crest of mountain standing
 A man might watch the people all around,
 E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,
 O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,
 Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples
 Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.

 Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!
 Thou leader of the caravan, without a debt!
 Walk in the world. Let the Blessed One
 Teach dhamma; they who learn will grow.'

 And then I, Prince, having understood Brahmā's entreaty,
 out of compassion
 surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One.

 As I, Prince, was surveying the world
 with the eye of an Awakened One,
 I saw beings with little dust in their eyes,
 with much dust in their eyes,
 with acute faculties
 with dull faculties,
 of good dispositions,
 of bad dispositions,
 docile,
 indocile,
 few seeing from fear
 sins and the world beyond.

 Even as in a pond of blue lotuses
 or in a pond of red lotuses
 or in a pond of white lotuses,
 a few red lotuses,
 a few blue lotuses,
 a few white lotuses
 are born in the water,
 grow in the water,
 do not rise above the water
 but thrive while altogether immersed;
 a few blue lotuses,
 a few red lotuses,
 a few white lotuses
 are born in the water,
 grow in the water
 and reach the surface of the water
 a few blue lotuses,
 a few red lotuses,
 a few white lotuses
 are born in the water,
 grow in the water
 and stand rising out of the water,
 undefiled by the water;
 even so did I, Prince,
 surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One,
 see beings with little dust in their eyes,
 with much dust in their eyes,
 with acute faculties,
 with dull faculties,
 of good dispositions,
 of bad dispositions,
 docile,
 indocile,
 few seeing from fear
 sins and the world beyond.

 Then I, Prince, addressed Brahmā Sahampati in verses:

 Opened for those who hear are the doors of the Deathless, Brahmā,
 Let them give forth their faith;
 Thinking of useless fatigue, Brahmā, I have not preached dhamma
 Sublime and excellent for men.

 Then, Prince, Brahmā Sahampati, thinking:

 'The opportunity was made by me
 for the Lord to teach dhamma,'
 having greeted me,
 keeping his right side towards me,
 vanished then and there.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'Now, to whom should I first teach this dhamma?

 Who will understand this dhamma quickly?'

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'Indeed this Āḷāra the Kālāma is learned,
 experienced,
 wise,
 and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes.

 Suppose that I were to teach dhamma first to Āḷāra the Kālāma
 he will understand this dhamma quickly.

 Then devatās having approached me,
 spoke thus:

 Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago.'

 So knowledge and vision arose in me
 that Āḷāra the Kālāma had passed away seven days ago.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'Āḷāra the Kālāma has suffered a great loss.

 For if he had heard this dhamma,
 he would have understood it quickly.'

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'Now, to whom could I first teach this dhamma?
 Who will understand this dhamma quickly?

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'This Uddaka, Rāma's son, is learned,
 experienced,
 wise,
 and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes.

 Suppose that I were to teach dhamma first to Uddaka, Rāma's son?

 He will understand this dhamma quickly,'

 Then, Prince, devatās, having approached me,
 spoke thus:

 'Lord, Uddaka, Rāma's son, passed away last night,'

 So knowledge and vision arose in me
 that Uddaka, Rāma's son,
 had passed away last night.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'Uddaka, Rāma's son, has suffered a great loss.

 For if he had heard this dhamma,
 he would have understood it quickly.

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:

 'Now to whom could I first teach this dhamma?

 Who will understand this dhamma quickly?

 Then it occurred to me, Prince:
 'This group of five monks
 who waited on me
 when I was self-resolute in striving,
 were very helpful.

 Suppose that I were to teach dhamma first to this group of five monks?

 Then it occurred to me, monks:

 'But where is the group of five monks staying at present?

 Then, monks I saw with deva-vision,
 purified
 and surpassing that of men,
 the group of five monks
 staying near Benares
 at Isipatana
 in the deer-park.

 Then I, monks, having stayed at Uruvelā
 for as long as I found suiting,
 set out on tour for Benares.

 Then, monks, Upaka,
 the Naked Ascetic,
 saw me as I was going along the high road
 between Gayā and the (Tree of) Awakening;
 having seen me,
 he spoke thus:

 'Your reverence,
 your faculties are quite pure,
 your complexion is very bright,
 very clear.

 On account of whom
 have you, your reverence, gone forth,
 or who is your teacher,
 or whose dhamma do you profess?'

 When this had been said,
 I, monks, addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic,
 in verses:

 'Victorious over all, omniscient am I,
 Among all things undefiled,
 Leaving all, through death of craving freed,
 By knowing for myself, whom should I point to?

 For me there is no teacher,
 One like me does not exist,
 In the world with its devas
 No one equals me.

 For I am perfected in the world,
 A teacher supreme am I,
 I alone am all-awakened,
 Become cool am I, Nibbāna-attained.

 To turn the dhamma-wheel
 I go to Kasi's city,
 Beating the drum of deathlessness
 In a world that's blind become.'

 'According to what you claim, your reverence,
 you ought to be victor of the unending.'

 'Like me, they are victors indeed
 Who have won destruction of the cankers;
 Vanquished by me are evil things,
 Therefore am I, Upaka, a victor.'

 When this had been said, Prince,
 Upaka the Naked Ascetic, having said:
 'May it be (so), your reverence"

 having shaken his head,
 went off having taken a different road.

 Then I, Prince, walking on tour,
 in due course arrived at Benares,
 Isipatana,
 the deer-park
 and the group of five monks.

 Prince, the group of five monks
 saw me coming in the distance,
 and seeing me
 they agreed among themselves, saying:

 'Your reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming,
 he lives in abundance,
 he is wavering in his striving,
 he has reverted to a life of abundance.

 He should be neither greeted,
 nor stood up for,
 nor should his bowl and robe be received;
 all the same
 a seat may be put out,
 he can sit down if he wants to.'

 But as I, Prince, gradually approached this group of five monks,
 so this group of five monks
 were not able to adhere to their own agreement;
 having approached me
 some received my bowl and robe,
 some made a seat ready,
 some brought water for washing the feet,
 and they addressed me by my name
 and with the epithet 'your reverence.'
 When this had been said,
 I, Prince, spoke thus to the group of five monks:

 'Do not, monks, address a Tathāgata by his name
 or by the epithet 'your reverence.'

 Monks, the Tathāgata is one perfected, a fully Self-awakened One.

 Give ear, monks, the deathless is found,
 I instruct, I teach dhamma.

 Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,
 having soon realised here and now
 by your own super-knowledge
 that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home
 into homelessness,
 you will abide in it.'

 When this had been said, Prince,
 the group of five monks addressed me thus:

 'But you, reverend Gotama,
 did not come to a state of further-men,
 to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans
 by this conduct,
 by this course,
 by this practice of austerities.

 So how can you now
 come to a state of further-men,
 to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans
 when you live in abundance
 and, wavering in your striving,
 revert to a life of abundance?'
 When this had been said, Prince, I spoke to the group of five monks thus:

 'A Tathāgata, monks,
 does not live in abundance
 nor, wavering in striving,
 does he revert to a life of abundance.

 The Tathāgata, monks,
 is one perfected,
 a fully Self-awakened One.

 Give ear, monks,
 the deathless is found,
 I instruct,
 I teach dhamma.

 Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,
 having soon realised here and now
 by your own super-knowledge
 that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home
 into homelessness,
 you will abide in it.'

 And a second time, Prince, the group of five monks spoke to me thus:

 'But you, reverend Gotama,
 did not come to a state of further-men,
 to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans
 by this conduct,
 by this course,
 by this practice of austerities.

 So how can you now
 come to a state of further-men,
 to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans
 when you live in abundance
 and, wavering in your striving,
 revert to a life of abundance?'

 When this had been said, Prince, I spoke to the group of five monks thus:

 'A Tathāgata, monks,
 does not live in abundance
 nor, wavering in striving,
 does he revert to a life of abundance.

 The Tathāgata, monks,
 is one perfected,
 a fully Self-awakened One.

 Give ear, monks,
 the deathless is found,
 I instruct,
 I teach dhamma.

 Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,
 having soon realised here and now
 by your own super-knowledge
 that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home
 into homelessness,
 you will abide in it.'

 And a third time, monks, the group of five monks spoke to me thus:

 'But you, reverend Gotama,
 did not come to a state of further-men,
 to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans
 by this conduct,
 by this course,
 by this practice of austerities.
 So how can you now
 come to a state of further-men,
 to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans
 when you live in abundance
 and, wavering in your striving,
 revert to a life of abundance?'

 When this had been said,
 I, Prince, spoke thus to the group of five monks:

 'Do you allow, monks,
 that I have ever spoken to you like this before?'

 'You have not, Lord.'

 The Tathāgata, monks,
 is one perfected,
 a fully Self-awakened One.

 Give ear, monks,
 the deathless is found,
 I instruct,
 I teach dhamma.

 Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,
 having soon realised here and now
 by your own super-knowledge
 that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home
 into homelessness,
 you will abide in it.'

 And I, Prince, was able to convince the group of five monks.

 Prince, I now exhorted two monks;
 three monks walked for almsfood.
 Whatever the three monks who had walked for alms- food brought back,
 that the group of six lived on.

 And then, Prince, I exhorted three monks;
 two monks walked for almsfood.

 Whatever the two monks who had walked for almsfood brought back,
 that the group of six lived on.

 Then, Prince, the group of five monks,
 being thus exhorted,
 thus instructed by me,
 soon realising here and now
 by their own super-knowledge
 that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home into homelessness,
 entering on it abided in it."

 When this had been said,
 Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:

 "After how long, revered sir,
 does a monk
 taking the Tathāgata as a leader,
 and having by his own super-knowledge
 realised here and now
 that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home into homelessness,
 entering on it, abide in it?"

 "Well then, Prince,
 I will ask you a question about this in return.

 As it may please you,
 so should you answer it.
 What do you think about this, Prince?

 Are you skilled in elephant-riding,
 in the art of handling a goad?"

 "Yes, I, revered sir, am skilled in elephant-riding,
 in the art of handling a goad."

 "What do you think about this, Prince?

 A man might come along here, and think:

 'Prince Bodhi knows how to ride elephants
 and the art of handling the goad.

 I will train myself in elephant-riding
 and the art of handling the goad under him.'

 But had he no faith
 he could not attain
 whatever is to be won by faith;
 and had he [282] poor health
 he could not attain
 whatever is to be won by good health;
 and if he were fraudulent and deceitful
 he could not attain
 whatever is to be won by honesty
 and the absence of deceit;
 and if he were lazy
 he could not attain
 whatever is to be won by the output of energy;
 and if he were poor in wisdom
 he could not attain
 whatever is to be won by one of wisdom.

 What do you think about this, Prince?
 Could that man train himself
 in elephant-riding
 and the art of handling the goad under you?"

 "Assuredly, revered sir,
 if that man were possessed of (such) qualities,
 he could not train himself in elephant-riding
 and the art of handling the goad under me.

 But who speaks of five qualities?"

 "What do you think about this, Prince?

 A man might come along here, and think:

 'Prince Bodhi knows how to ride elephants
 and the art of handling the goad.

 I will train myself in elephant-riding
 and the art of handling the goad under him.'

 And if he had faith
 he could attain
 whatever is to be won by faith;
 and if he had good health
 he could attain
 whatever is to be won by good health;
 and if he were not fraudulent or deceitful
 he could attain
 whatever is to be won by honesty
 and the absence of deceit;
 and if he had an output of energy
 he could attain
 whatever is to be won by output of energy;
 and if he were one of wisdom
 he could attain
 whatever is to be won by one of wisdom.
 What do you think about this, Prince?

 Could that man train himself in elephant-riding
 and in the art of handling the goad under you?"

 "Assuredly, revered sir,
 if that man were possessed of (such) qualities,
 he could train himself in elephant-riding
 and the art of handhng the goad under me.

 But who speaks of five qualities?"

 "Even so, Prince,
 are these five qualities for striving.[6]

 What five?

 As to this, Prince,
 a monk has faith;
 he has faith in the awakening of the Tathāgata, and thinks:

 'Indeed this is the Lord,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One,
 endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,
 Well-farer,
 knower of the worlds,
 incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,
 teacher of devas and men,
 the Awakened One,
 the Lord.'

 He is well,
 in good health,
 endowed with a good digestion,
 not over-cool,
 not over-hot,
 but of a middle kind
 suitable for striving.

 He is not fraudulent,
 not deceitful,
 but shows himself as he really is
 to the Teacher
 or the learned
 among his fellow Brahma-farers.

 He dwells with energy stirred up[7]
 for getting rid of unskilled states,
 for arousing skilled states,
 steadfast,
 firm in advance,
 persevering amid skilled states.

 He is one of wisdom
 endowed with wisdom[7]
 leading to (the cutting off of) rise and fall,
 with ariyan[8] [283] discrimination
 leading to the complete destruction of anguish.

 These, Prince, are the five qualities for striving.

 If, Prince, a monk is possessed of these five qualities for striving,
 taking the Tathāgata for leader,
 having by his own super-knowledge
 realised here and now
 that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring
 for the sake of which young men of family
 rightly go forth from home into homelessness,

 within seven years.
