# 68. Discourse at Naḷakapāna

## Naḷakapāna Sutta

#### [462] [135]

 THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna[2]
 in the Judas-tree Grove.[3]

 Now at that time
 many well known young men of family
 had gone forth from home
 into homelessness through faith in the Lord:
 the venerable Anuruddha[4]
 and the venerable Nandiya
 and the venerable Kimbila
 and the venerable Bhagu[5]
 and the venerable Kuṇḍadhāna[6]
 and the venerable Revata
 and the venerable Ānanda,
 and many other well known young men of family.
 Now at that time
 the Lord [463] was sitting in the open
 surrounded by an Order of monks.

 Then the Lord addressed the monks
 concerning these young men of family,
 saying:

 "Those young men of family, monks,
 who have gone forth from home
 into homelessness through faith in me  I hope, monks,
 that these monks are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"

 When he had spoken thus,
 these monks became silent.

 And a second time the Lord addressed the monks
 concerning these young men of family,
 saying:

 "Those young men of family, monks,
 who have gone forth from home
 into homelessness through faith in me  I hope, monks,
 that these monks are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"

 And a second time
 when he had spoken thus,
 these monks became silent.

 And a third time the Lord addressed the monks
 concerning these young men of family,
 saying:

 "Those young men of family, monks,
 who have gone forth from home
 into homelessness through faith in me  I hope, monks,
 that these monks are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"

 And a third time
 when he had spoken thus,
 these monks became silent.

 And a third time these monks became silent.

 Then it occurred to the Lord:

 "Now, suppose that I were to question
 these young men of family themselves?"

 Then the Lord addressed the venerable Anuruddha,
 saying:

 "I hope that you, Anuruddhas,[7]
 are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"

 "Certainly we, revered sir,
 are finding delight in the Brahma-faring."

 [136]

 "It is good, it is good, Anuruddhas.

 This is fitting in you, Anuruddhas,
 who are young men of family
 gone forth from home
 into homelessness through faith,
 that you should find delight in the Brahma-faring.

 Yet while you, Anuruddhas,
 possessed of radiant youth,
 in the prime of your lives,
 with coal-black hair,
 might be enjoying the pleasures of the senses,
 you, Anuruddhas,
 although possessed of radiant youth,
 in the prime of your lives,
 with coal-black hair,
 have nevertheless gone forth from home
 into homelessness.

 But you, Anuruddhas,
 are neither those that have gone forth
 from home into homelessness
 on the suggestion of kings[8]
 nor are you those who have gone forth
 from home into homelessness
 on the suggestion of thieves
 nor are you those who have gone forth
 from home into homelessness
 because of debt
 nor are you those who have gone forth
 from home into homelessness
 through fear,[9]
 nor are you those who have gone forth
 from home into homelessness
 because of having lost the means of livelihood.

 Yet was it not with the thought:

 'Although I am oppressed by birth,
 ageing,
 dying,
 by grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair,
 oppressed by anguish,
 overcome by anguish,
 yet perhaps some ending
 of this whole mass of anguish
 may be seen,'

 that you, Anuruddhas, have gone forth from home into homelessness through faith?"

 "Yes, revered sir."

 "And when, Anuruddhas,
 a young man of family has gone forth thus,
 what is there to be done by him?

 Anuruddhas,
 aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 if he does not win joy and happiness
 or something more peaceful than that,[10]
 then coveting persists in obsessing his mind,
 and malevolence persists in obsessing his mind,
 and sloth and torpor persists in obsessing his mind,
 and restlessness and worry persists in obsessing his mind,
 and doubt persists in obsessing his mind,

 [464]and discontent persists in obsessing his mind,
 and apathy persists in obsessing his mind.

 Aloof, Anuruddhas, from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 he does not win joy and happiness
 or something more peaceful than that.

 ■

 Anuruddhas, aloof from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 if he wins joy and happiness
 and something more peaceful than that,
 then coveting does not persist in obsessing his mind,
 and [137] malevolence does not persist in obsessing his mind,
 and sloth and torpor does not persist in obsessing his mind,
 and restlessness and worry does not persist in obsessing his mind,
 and doubt does not persist in obsessing his mind,
 and discontent does not persist in obsessing his mind,
 and apathy does not persist in obsessing his mind.

 Aloof, Anuruddhas,
 from pleasures of the senses,
 aloof from unskilled states of mind,
 he wins joy and happiness
 and something more peaceful than that.

 ■

 What do you think about me, Anuruddhas?

 That those cankers
 which have to do with the defilements,[11]
 with again-becoming,
 which are fearful,
 whose result is anguish,
 making for birth,
 ageing
 and dying
 in the future  that these have not been got rid of
 by the Tathāgata,
 and that therefore the Tathāgata,
 having considered,[12]
 pursues one thing;
 having considered,
 endures another thing;
 having considered,
 avoids another thing;
 having considered,
 controls another thing?"[13]

 "We, revered sir, do not think this of the Lord,
 that those cankers which have to do with the defilements,
 with again-becoming,
 which are fearful,
 whose result is anguish,
 making for birth,
 ageing
 and dying
 in the future  that these have not been got rid of
 by the Tathāgata,
 and that therefore the Tathāgata,
 having considered,
 pursues one thing;
 having considered,
 endures another thing;
 having considered,
 avoids another thing;
 having considered,
 controls another thing.

 We, revered sir, think this of the Lord,
 that those cankers that have to do with the defilements,
 with again-becoming,
 which are fearful,
 whose result is anguish,
 making for birth,
 ageing
 and dying
 in the future  that these have been got rid of by the Tathāgata,
 and that therefore the Tathāgata,
 having considered,
 pursues one thing;
 having considered,
 endures another thing;
 having considered,
 avoids another thing;
 having considered,
 controls another thing."

 "It is good,
 it is good, Anuruddhas.[14]

 Those cankers of the Tathāgata
 that had to do with the defilements,
 with again-becoming,
 which are fearful,
 whose result is anguish,
 making for birth,
 ageing
 and dying
 in the future  these have been got rid of,
 cut off at the root,
 made like a palm-tree stump
 that can come to no further existence in the future.

 Even, Anuruddhas, as a palm-tree
 whose crown is cut off
 can come to no further growth,
 so, Anuruddhas, those cankers of the Tathāgata
 that had to do with the defilements,
 with again-becoming,
 which are fearful,
 whose result is anguish,
 making for birth,
 ageing
 and dying
 in the future  these have been got rid of,
 cut off at the root,
 made like a palm-tree stump
 that can come to no further existence in the future.

 Therefore the Tathāgata,
 having considered,
 pursues one thing;
 having considered,
 endures another thing;
 having considered,
 avoids another thing;
 having considered,
 controls another thing."

 ■

 [138] What do you think about this, Anuruddhas?

 Beholding what special purpose
 does the Tathāgata explain
 the uprisings in which are disciples
 who have deceased and passed away,
 saying:

 'Such a one has uprisen in one,
 such a one has uprisen in another'?"[15]

 [465]"Things for us, Lord,
 are rooted in the Lord,
 have the Lord for conduit,
 the Lord for arbiter.
 It were good indeed, Lord,
 if the meaning of this speech of the Lord's
 were explained;
 having heard the Lord,
 monks would remember."[16]

 "Anuruddhas, the Tathāgata does not have the purpose[17] of defrauding people
 nor the purpose of cajoling people
 nor the purpose of gains,
 honour,
 fame
 and material advantages,
 nor the thought:

 'Let people know me thus'[18]
 when he explains
 the uprisings in which are disciples
 who have deceased and passed away,
 saying:

 'Such a one has uprisen in one,
 such a one has uprisen in another.'

 But there are, Anuruddhas,
 young men of family
 who have faith
 and are of great enthusiasm,[19]
 of great joyousness
 and who, having heard this,
 focus their minds on suchness.[20]

 Anuruddhas, this will be for their weal and happiness
 for a long time.

 ■
 In this case, Anuruddhas, a monk hears:

 'The monk so and so has passed away;
 it is declared by the Lord
 that he is established in profound knowledge.'

 If a venerable one
 has himself seen
 or has heard by hearsay
 that the venerable one
 was of such moral habit
 and that the venerable one
 was of such mentality[21]
 and that the venerable one
 was of such wisdom
 and that the venerable one
 was such an abider
 and that the venerable one
 was freed thus,
 he, while recollecting his faith
 and moral habit
 and learning
 and giving up
 and wisdom,
 focusses his mind on suchness.

 It is thus, Anuruddhas,
 that there is abiding in comfort for a monk.

 ■

 In this case, Anuruddhas, a monk hears:

 'The monk so and so has passed away;

 one that has attained nibbāna there,
 not liable to return from that world.'

 he is a once-returner
 who, having come back once only to this world,
 will make an end of anguish.'

 In this case, Anuruddhas, a monk hears:

 assured,
 bound for enlightenment.'

 The Tathāgata, Anuruddhas, does not have the purpose of de- [141] frauding people
 nor the purpose of cajoling people
 nor the purpose of gains,
 honour,
 fame
 and material advantages,
 nor the thought:
 'Let people know me thus'
 when he explains the uprising
 in which are disciples
 who have deceased and passed away,
 saying:
 'Such and such a one has uprisen in one,
 such a one has uprisen in another.'

 But there are, Anuruddhas,
 young men of family
 who have faith
 and are of great enthusiasm,
 of great joyousness,
 and who, having heard this,
 focus their minds on suchness.

 Anuruddhas, this will be for their weal and happiness
 for a long time,"

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, the venerable Anuruddha rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
