# 33. Greater Discourse on the Cowherd

## Mahā Gopālaka Sutta

#### Thus have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, possessed of eleven qualities
 a cowherd cannot be one to take care of a herd of cattle
 and to make it prosperous.

 Of what eleven?
 Herein, monks, a cowherd is not one who is versed in material shapes,[2]
 he is not skilled in (distinguishing) marks,
 he does not remove flies' eggs,
 he does not dress sores,
 he makes no fumigation,[3]
 he does not know what is a ford,
 he does not know [272] what is a watering-place,
 he does not know what is a road,
 he is not skilled in pastures,
 he is one who milks dry,
 he pays no special respect
 to those bulls who are the sires and leaders of the herd.

 Monks, if a cowherd is possessed of these eleven qualities,
 he cannot be one to take care of the herd
 and make it prosperous.

 ■

 Even so, monks, if a monk is possessed of eleven qualities,
 he cannot become one to reach growth,
 increase
 and maturity in this dhamma and discipline.

 With what eleven?

 Herein, monks, a monk is one who is not versed in material shapes,
 he is not skilled in (distinguishing) marks,
 he does not remove flies' eggs,
 he does not dress sores,
 he makes no fumigation,
 he does not know what is a ford,
 he does not know what is a watering-place,
 he does not know what is a road,
 he is not skilled in pastures,
 he is one who milks dry,
 he pays no special respect
 to those monks who are elders
 and have gone forth many a day
 and are the sires and leaders of the Order.

 And how, monks, is a monk not versed in material shapes?

 Herein, monks, a monk
 in regard to material shape
 does not comprehend as it really is
 that all material shape is of the four great elements
 and that material shape is derived from the four great elements.[4]

 Even so, monks, is a monk not versed in material shapes.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 not skilled in (distinguishing) marks?

 Herein, monks, a monk
 does not comprehend as it really is:
 A fool is marked by his deed,
 a sage is marked by his deed.[5]

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 not skilled in (distinguishing) marks.
 And how, monks, is a monk
 not one to remove flies' eggs?

 Herein,[6] monks, a monk gives in
 to thought about sense-pleasures that has arisen,
 does not get rid of it,
 does not avert it,
 does not make an end of it,
 does not send it to non-existence.

 ■

 He gives in
 to thought of malevolence that has arisen,
 does not get rid of it,
 does not avert it,
 does not make an end of it,
 does not send it to non-existence.

 ■

 He gives in
 to thought of harming that has arisen,
 does not get rid of it,
 does not avert it,
 does not make an end of it,
 does not send it to non-existence.

 ■

 He gives in
 to evil unskilled mental objects that have constantly arisen,
 does not get rid of them,
 does not avert them,
 does not make an end of them,
 does not send them to non-existence.

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one who does not remove flies' eggs.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who does not dress a sore?

 Herein, monks, a monk, having seen material shape with the eye,
 is entranced by its general appearance,[7]
 is entranced by its detail.

 [273] Although coveting and dejection[8]  evil unskilled states  might get power over one who fares along
 with his organ of sight uncontrolled,
 he does not proceed to control it,
 he does not guard the organ of sight,
 he does not come to control over the organ of sight.

 ■

 Having heard a sound with the ear,
 is entranced by its general appearance,
 is entranced by its detail.

 Although coveting and dejection  evil unskilled states  might get power over one who fares along

 he does not proceed to control it,

 ■

 Having smelt a smell with the nose,
 is entranced by its general appearance,
 is entranced by its detail.

 ■

 Having savoured a taste with the tongue,
 is entranced by its general appearance,

 ■

 Having felt a touch with the body,
 is entranced by its general appearance,

 Although coveting and dejection  evil unskilled states  might get power over one who fares along
 with his organ of mind uncontrolled,
 he does not proceed to control it,
 he does not guard the organ of mind,
 he does not come to control over the organ of mind.

 Even so, monks, is a monk one who does not dress a sore.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who does not make a fumigation?

 Herein, monks, a monk
 does not teach dhamma to others
 in detail
 as he has heard it,
 as he has borne it in mind.
 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one who does not make a fumigation.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who does not know a ford?

 Herein, monks, a monk
 who from time to time
 has approached those monks who have heard much,
 to whom the tradition has been handed down,
 experts in dhamma,
 experts in discipline,
 experts in the summaries,
 yet he does not question them,
 does not interrogate them, saying:

 'How is this, revered ones?

 What is the meaning of this, revered ones?'

 These venerable ones do not disclose to him
 what was not disclosed,
 they do not make clear
 what was not made clear,
 and on various doubtful points in dhamma
 they do not resolve his doubts.

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one who does not know a ford.
 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who does not know a watering-place?

 Herein, monks, a monk,
 while dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata are being taught,
 does not acquire knowledge of the goal,[9]
 does not acquire knowledge of dhamma,
 does not acquire the delight
 that is connected with dhamma.

 Even so, monks, is a monk one who does not know a watering-place.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who does not know a road?

 Herein, monks, a monk
 does not comprehend the ariyan eightfold Way as it really is.

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one who does not know the road.

 [274] And how, monks, is a monk
 not skilled in pastures?
 Herein, monks, a monk
 does not comprehend as they really are
 the four arousings of mindfulness.

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one not skilled in pastures.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who milks dry?

 Herein, monks, when householders with faith
 invite a monk to take[10] the requisites
 of robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodgings
 and medicines for the sick,
 he does not know moderation in accepting such.

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one who milks dry.

 And how, monks, is a monk
 one who pays no special respect
 to the monks who are elders,
 gone forth many a day,
 the sires and leaders of the Order?
 Herein, monks, a monk[11] does not make friendliness as to acts of body
 rise up either openly or in private
 for those monks who are elders,
 gone forth many a day,
 the sires and leaders of the Order;
 he does not make friendliness as to acts of speech
 rise up either openly or in private,
 he does not make friendliness as to acts of thought
 rise up either openly or in private.

 Even so, monks, is a monk
 one who pays no special respect
 to the monks who are elders,
 gone forth many a day,
 the sires and leaders of the Order.

 Monks, possessed of these eleven qualities
 a monk cannot become one to reach growth,
 increase,
 maturity in this dhamma and discipline.

 §

 Monks, possessed of eleven qualities,
 a cowherd can become one
 to take care of a herd of cattle
 and make it prosperous.
