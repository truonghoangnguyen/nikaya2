# 40. Lesser Discourse at Assapura

## Cūḷa Assapura Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying among the Aṅgas;
 a township of the Aṅgas was called Assapura.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 [335] "Revered one,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "'Recluses, recluses,'
 so the people know you, monks,
 and you, on being asked:
 'Who are yon?'

 should acknowledge:

 'We are recluses.'

 Such being your, designations, monks,
 such being your vocations,
 thus you should train yourselves, monks:

 'We will follow those practices
 which are fitting for recluses;
 thus will this designation of ours
 become true
 and the vocation real;
 and the gifts of those things we make use of  robe-material,
 almsfood,
 lodging,
 medicines for the sick  will come to be of great fruit,
 of great advantage to us;
 and this our going forth
 will come to be not barren
 but fruitful
 and growing.'

 And how, monks, does a monk come to be one
 who is not following the practice
 that is fitting for recluses?

 Monks, in any monk who is covetous,
 covetousness not got rid of;
 who is malevolent in mind,
 malevolence not got rid of;
 who is wrathful,
 wrath not got rid of;
 who is grudging,
 grudging not got rid of;
 who is hypocritical,
 hypocrisy not got rid of;
 who is spiteful,
 spite not got rid of;
 who is jealous,
 jealousy not got rid of;
 who is stingy,
 stinginess not got rid of;
 who is treacherous,
 treachery not got rid of;
 who is crafty,
 craftiness not got rid of;
 who is of evil desires,
 evil desires not got rid of;
 who is of wrong view,
 wrong view not got rid of  I, monks, say
 that if he does not follow
 the practice fitting for recluses,
 there is no getting rid of these stains on recluses,
 defects in recluses,
 faults in recluses,
 occasions for the sorrowful states,
 of what is to be experienced in a bad bourn.

 Monks, as a deadly weapon[1] for fighting with,
 double-edged
 and whetted sharp,
 may be covered
 and enveloped
 by his outer cloak  unto this do I, monks,
 liken this monk's going forth.
 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who wears an outer cloak
 depends merely on his wearing an outer cloak.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who is unclothed
 depends merely on his being unclothed.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one living in dust and dirt
 depends merely on his living in dust and dirt.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who bathes ceremonially[2]
 depends merely on the ceremonial bathing.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who [336] lives at the root of a tree
 depends merely on his living at the root of a tree.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who lives in the open
 depends merely on his living in the open.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who stands erect
 depends merely on his standing erect.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who lives on a regimen[3]
 depends merely on his living on a regimen.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who meditates on chants[4]
 depends merely on his meditating on chants.

 I, monks, do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who has matted hair
 depends merely on his matted hair.

 If, monks, the covetousness
 of one who is covetous
 and who wears an outer cloak
 could be got rid of
 merely by wearing an outer cloak;

 if the malevolence of mind
 of one who is malevolent;

 if the wrath
 of one who is wrathful;

 if the grudging
 of one who is grudging;

 if the hypocrisy
 of one who is hypocritical;
 if the spite
 of one who is spiteful;

 if the jealousy
 of one who is jealous;

 if the stinginess
 of one who is stingy;

 if the treachery
 of one who is treacherous;

 if the craftiness
 of one who is crafty;

 if the evil desires
 of one who is of evil desires;

 if the wrong view
 of one who is of wrong view
 and who wears an outer cloak
 could be got rid of
 merely by wearing an outer cloak;

 then his friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 would make him wear an outer cloak
 from the very day that he was born,
 would encourage him to wear an outer cloak,
 saying:

 'Come, you auspicious-faced,[5]
 become a wearer of an outer cloak,
 for on your being a wearer of an outer cloak
 the covetousness
 of one who is covetous
 will be got rid of,
 merely by wearing an outer cloak;

 the malevolence of mind
 of one who is malevolent;

 the wrath
 of one who is wrathful;

 the grudging
 of one who is grudging;

 the hypocrisy
 of one who is hypocritical;

 the spite
 of one who is spiteful;

 the jealousy
 of one who is jealous;

 the stinginess
 of one who is stingy;

 the treachery
 of one who is treacherous;

 the craftiness
 of one who is crafty;

 the evil desires
 of one who is of evil desires;

 the wrong view
 of one who is of wrong view
 and who wears an outer cloak
 will be got rid of
 merely by wearing an outer cloak';

 therefore I do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who wears an outer cloak
 depends merely on his wearing an outer cloak.

 If, monks, the covetousness
 of one who is covetous
 and who is unclothed
 could be got rid of
 merely by being unclothed;

 of one who is crafty;

 if the evil desires
 of one who is of evil desires;

 if the wrong view
 of one who is of wrong view
 and who is unclothed
 could be got rid of
 merely by being unclothed;

 then his friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 would make him go unclothed
 from the very day that he was born,
 would encourage him to go unclothed,
 saying:

 'Come, you auspicious-faced,
 become one who goes unclothed,
 for on your being one who goes unclothed
 the covetousness
 of one who is covetous
 will be got rid of,
 merely by being unclothed;

 the malevolence of mind

 of one who is crafty;

 the evil desires
 of one who is of evil desires;

 the wrong view
 of one who is of wrong view
 and who is unclothed
 will be got rid of,
 merely by being unclothed;

 therefore I do not say
 that the recluseship
 of one who goes unclothed
 depends merely on his being unclothed.
 If, monks, the covetousness
 of one who is covetous
 and who lives in dust and dirt
 could be got rid of
 merely by living in dust and dirt;

 if the wrong view

 then his friends and acquaintances,
 kith and kin,
 would make go live in dust and dirt
 from the very day that he was born,
 would encourage him to live in dust and dirt,
 saying:

 'Come, you auspicious-faced,
 become one who lives in dust and dirt,
 for on your being one who lives in dust and dirt
 the covetousness
 of one who is covetous
 will be got rid of,
 merely by living in dust and dirt;

 of one who lives in dust and dirt
 depends merely by living in dust and dirt.

 He beholds the self purified
 of all these evil unskilled states,
 he beholds the self freed.

 When he beholds the self purified
 of all these evil unskilled states,
 when he beholds the self feed,
 delight is born;
 rapture is born from delight;
 when he is in rapture
 the body is impassible;
 when the body is impassible
 he experiences joy;
 being joyful,
 the mind is concentrated.

 He dwells,

 wide-spread,
 immeasurable,
 without enmity,
 without malevolence.

 Monks, it is as if[6] there were a lovely lotus-pond
 with clear water,
 sweet water,
 cool water,
 limpid,
 with beautiful banks;
 and if a man were to come along from the east,
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,[7]
 exhausted,
 parched
 and thirsty,
 he, on coming to that lotus-pond,
 might quench[8] his thirst with water,
 might quench the hot-weather fever.

 And if a man were to come along from the west,
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched
 and thirsty,
 he, on coming to that lotus-pond,
 might quench his thirst with water,
 might quench the hot-weather fever.

 And if a man were to come along from the north,
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched
 and thirsty,
 he, on coming to that lotus-pond,
 might quench his thirst with water,
 might quench the hot-weather fever.

 And if a man were to come along from the south,
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched
 and thirsty,
 he, on coming to that lotus-pond,
 might quench his thirst with water,
 might quench the hot-weather fever.

 From wherever a man might come along,
 overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat,
 exhausted,
 parched
 and thirsty,
 he, on coming to that lotus-pond,
 might quench his thirst with water,
 might quench the hot-weather fever.
