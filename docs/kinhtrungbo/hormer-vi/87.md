# 87. Discourse on "Born of Affection"

## Piya-Jātika Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 Now at that time
 the dear and beloved
 little only son of a certain householder
 had passed away.

 After he had passed away
 he (the father) had no inclination for work
 or for food.

 Going constantly to the cemetery,
 he wailed:

 "Where are you, little only son?
 Where are you, little only son?"

 Then that householder approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 having greeted the Lord,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 The Lord spoke thus to that householder
 as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 "Have not you, householder, controlling faculties
 for stilling your own mind?

 There is a change in your faculties."

 "But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord?

 For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son
 has passed away.

 Since he passed away
 I have no inclination for work
 or food.

 Going constantly to the cemetery,
 I wail:
 'Where are you, little only son?
 Where are you, little only son?'"

 "That is just it, householder.

 For, householder, grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection."

 "But for whom, Lord,
 could this hold good in this way:

 'Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection?'

 For, Lord, bliss and happiness
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection."

 [293] Then the householder,
 not rejoicing in what the Lord had said,
 repudiating it,
 rising from his seat,
 departed.

 Now at that time
 a number of gamblers were playing dice
 not far from the Lord.

 Then that householder
 approached these gamblers;
 having approached,
 he spoke thus to these gamblers:

 "Now, I, sirs, approached the recluse Gotama;
 having approached,
 having greeted the recluse Gotama,
 I sat down at a respectful distance.
 Then, sirs, the recluse Gotama spoke thus to me
 as I was sitting down at a respectful distance:

 'Have not you, householder, controlling faculties
 for stilling your own mind?

 There is a change in your faculties.'

 'But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord?

 For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son
 has passed away.

 Since he passed away
 I have no inclination for work
 or food.

 Going constantly to the cemetery,
 I wail:
 "Where are you, little only son?
 Where are you, little only son?"'

 'That is just it, householder.

 For, householder, grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection.'

 'But for whom, Lord,
 could this hold good in this way:

 "Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection?"

 For, Lord, bliss and happiness
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection.'

 Then I, sirs, not rejoicing in what the Lord had said,
 repudiating it,
 rising from my seat,
 departed."

 "That is just it, householder,
 that is just it, householder;
 for, householder,
 bliss and happiness are born of affection,
 originate in affection."

 Then the householder, thinking:

 "There is agreement
 between me and the gamblers,"
 departed.

 Then this subject of conversation[1]
 gradually penetrated the royal palace.

 And King Pasenadi of Kosala
 spoke thus to Queen Mallikā:

 "This was said to these, Mallikā, by the recluse Gotama:

 'Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection.'"

 "If this, sire, was said by the Lord,
 it is so."

 "As the recluse Gotama speaks
 so does Mallikā
 because she is much delighted with him:

 'If this, sire, was said by the Lord,
 it is so.'

 It is just as when a teacher speaks to his pupil
 and the pupil is so much delighted with him
 that he says
 'It is just so, teacher,
 it is just so, teacher.'

 Even so do you, Mallikā,
 because you are so much delighted
 with what the recluse Gotama says,
 say:
 'If this, sire, was said by the Lord,
 it is so.'

 Be off, Mallikā, go away."

 Then Queen Mallikā
 summoned the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha,
 and said:

 "Come you, brahman,
 approach the Lord;
 having approached,
 in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head
 and ask whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort;
 and say:

 'Lord, Queen Mallika salutes the Lord's feet with her head,
 and asks whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort.'

 and then say:

 'Revered sir,
 were these words spoken by the Lord:

 Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection?'

 And when you have mastered well
 what the Lord [294] explains to you,
 you must tell me.

 For Tathāgatas do not speak against the truth."[2]

 "Yes, madam,"
 and the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha,
 having answered Queen Mallikā in assent,
 approached the Lord;
 having approached,
 he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
 having conversed in a courteous and friendly way,
 he sat down at a respectful distance.

 As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
 the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha, spoke thus to the Lord;

 "Good Gotama, Queen Mallikā with her head
 salutes the good Gotama's feet
 and asks whether he is well,
 not indisposed,
 of bodily vigour,
 strong,
 abiding in comfort.

 And she speaks thus:

 'Revered sir, were these words spoken by the Lord:

 Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection?'

 "It is just so, brahman,
 it is just so, brahman.

 For, brahman, grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection.

 And this is a way, brahman,
 in which it can be said
 that grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection:

 Once upon a time, brahman,
 in this very Sāvatthī
 a certain woman's mother had passed away.

 Since her passing away,
 she (the daughter), unbalanced and unhinged,
 went from street to street,
 from cross-road to cross-road,
 saying:

 'Have you not seen my mother?

 Have you not seen my mother?'

 a certain woman went to her relation's family.

 Those relations of hers,
 having forcibly taken her from her husband,
 desired to give her to another,
 but she did not want him.

 Then that woman spoke thus to her husband:

 'These relations of mine, master,
 having forcibly taken me from you,
 want to give me to [295] another,
 but I do not want him.'

 Then that man,
 having cut that woman in two,
 destroyed himself,
 thinking:
 'We will both come to be hereafter.'

 This too is a way, brahman,

 Then the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha,
 having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,
 having given thanks,
 rising from his seat
 approached Queen Mallikā;
 having approached,
 he recounted to her
 the whole of the conversation he had had with the Lord.

 Then Queen Mallikā approached King Pasenadi;
 having approached,
 she spoke thus to King Pasenadi:

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 Is your daughter Vajīrī dear to you?"

 "Yes, Mallikā.

 My daughter Vajīrī is dear to me."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 From an alteration
 and otherness
 in your daughter Vajīrī
 would there arise in you grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair?"

 "From an alteration
 and otherness, Mallikā,
 in my daughter Vajīrī
 there would be a change for me,
 even for life.

 How should there not arise in me grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair?"

 "It was in reference to this, sire,
 that it was said by the Lord,
 who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One:

 'Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection.'

 ■

 What do you think about this, sire?
 Is the noble lady Vāsabhā[3] dear to you?"

 "Yes, Mallikā, the noble lady Vāsabhā is dear to me."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 From an alteration
 and otherness
 in the noble lady Vāsabhā
 would there arise in you grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair?"

 "From an alteration
 and otherness, Mallikā,
 in the noble lady Vāsabhā
 there would be a change for me,
 even for life.

 How should there not arise in me grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair?"

 "It was in reference to this, sire,
 that it was said by the Lord,
 who knows,

 fully Self-Awakened One:

 'Grief,

 lamentation

 ■

 What do you think about this, sire?

 Is the General Viḍūḍabha[4] dear to you?"

 "Yes, Mallikā, the General Viḍūḍabha is dear to me."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 From an alteration
 and otherness
 in the General Viḍūḍabha
 would there arise in you grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,

 and despair?"

 "From an alteration

 ■

 What do you think about this, sire?

 Am I dear to you?"[5]

 "Yes, Mallikā, you are dear to me."

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 ■

 What do you think about this, sire?

 Are the peoples of Kāsi and Kosala dear to you?"

 "Yes, Mallikā, the peoples of Kāsi and Kosala are dear to me.

 Because of their might
 we obtain sandal wood from the country of Kāsi
 and use sweet-smelling garlands and perfumes.""

 "What do you think about this, sire?

 From an alteration
 and [296] otherness
 in the peoples of Kāsi and Kosala
 would there arise in you grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair?"

 "From an alteration
 and otherness, Mallikā,
 in the peoples of Kāsi and Kosala
 there would be a change for me,
 even for life.

 How should there not arise in me grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair?"

 "It was in reference to this, sire,

 who knows,
 who sees,
 perfected one,
 fully Self-Awakened One:

 'Grief,
 sorrow,
 suffering,
 lamentation
 and despair
 are born of affection,
 originate in affection.'

 It is wonderful, Mallikā,
 it is marvellous, Mallikā,
 how much the Lord,
 penetrating through wisdom,
 sees by means of wisdom.[6]

 Come, Mallikā,
 let me wash (ceremonially)."[7]

 Then King Pasenadi,
 rising from his seat,
 having arranged his upper garment over one shoulder,
 having saluted the Lord with joined palms,
 three times uttered this solemn utterance:

 "Praise to the Lord,
 the perfected one,
 the fully Self-Awakened One.

 "Praise to the Lord,
 the perfected one,
 the fully Self-Awakened One.

 "Praise to the Lord,
 the perfected one,
 the fully Self-Awakened One."
