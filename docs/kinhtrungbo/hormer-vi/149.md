# 149. Discourse Pertaining to the Great Sixfold (Sense-) Field

## Mahā Saḷāyatanika Sutta

#### THUS HAVE I HEARD:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī
 in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "I will teach you, monks,
 the great sixfold (sense-)field.
 Listen to it,
 attend carefully
 and I will speak."

 "Yes, revered sir,"
 these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Monks, (anyone) not knowing,
 not seeing
 eye as it really is,

 not knowing,
 not seeing
 material shapes as it really is,

 not knowing,
 not seeing
 visual consciousness as it really is,

 not knowing,
 not seeing
 impact on the eye as it really is,

 and not knowing,
 not seeing
 as it really is the experience,
 whether pleasant,
 painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 that arises conditioned by impact on the eye,
 is attached to the eye,

 is attached to [337] visual consciousness,
 is attached to impact on the eye;
 and as for that experience,
 whether pleasant,
 painful
 or neither painful nor pleasant,
 that arises conditioned by impact on the eye  to that too is he attached.

 While he,
 observing the satisfaction,
 is attached,
 bound
 and infatuated,
 the five groups of grasping
 go on to future accumulation.[2]

 And his craving,
 which is connected with again-becoming,
 accompanied by attachment
 and delight,
 finding its pleasure here and there,
 increases in him.

 And his physical anxieties increase,
