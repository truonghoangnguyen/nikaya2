# 6. Discourse on What One May Wish

## Ākaṇkheyya Sutta

#### THUS have I heard:[2]:

 At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

 While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:

 "Monks."

 "Revered one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.

 The Lord spoke thus:

 "Fare along, monks, possessed of moral habit,
 possessed of the Obligations,
 fare along controlled by the control of the Obligations,
 possessed of right conduct and resort,
 seeing danger in the slightest faults;
 undertaking them rightly,
 train yourselves in the rules of training.[3]

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I be agreeable to my fellow Brahma-farers,
 liked by them,
 revered and respected,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,[4]
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,[5]
 a cultivator of empty places.[6]

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I be one who receives the requisites of robes,
 almsfood,
 lodgings,
 and medicines for the sick,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May these services of those[7] from whom I enjoy the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, requisites for the sick, be of great merit, of great advantage,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May this be a great fruit,
 a great [42] advantage
 to those of my kith and kin
 who, their minds pleased,
 recollect the departed
 who have passed away,'[8]

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I be one
 who overcomes aversion[9]
 and liking[10],
 and may aversion not overcome me,
 may I fare along
 constantly conquering any aversion that has arisen,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I be one
 who overcomes fear and dread,
 and may fear and dread
 not overcome me,
 may I fare along constantly conquering
 any fear and dread that has arisen,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I be one
 who, at will,[11]
 without trouble,
 without difficulty,
 acquires the four meditations
 which are of the purest mentality,
 abidings in ease here-now,[12]'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'Those incorporeal deliverances[13] which are calmed,
 transcending forms,
 may I fare along
 having realised[14] them
 while in the body,'[15],'
 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'By the total destruction
 of the three fetters
 may I be a stream-attainer,[16]
 not liable to the Downfall,
 assured,
 bound for awakening,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'By the total destruction
 of the three fetters,
 by the reduction of attachment,
 aversion,
 confusion,
 may I be a once-returner;
 having come back once only to this [43] world,
 may I make an end of anguish,'[17],'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'By the total destruction
 of the five fetters
 that bind one to the lower world,[18]
 may I be of spontaneous uprising,
 one who has utterly attained to Nibbāna there,[19] not liable to return from that world,[20],'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I experience the various forms of psychic power:[21]

 Having been one
 may I be manifold,
 having been manifold
 may I be one;
 manifest or invisible
 may I go unhindered through a wall,
 through a rampart,
 through a mountain
 as if through air;
 may I plunge into the ground
 and shoot up again
 as if in water;
 may I walk upon the water
 without parting it
 as if on the ground;
 sitting cross-legged
 may I travel through the air
 like a bird on the wing;
 with my hand
 may I rub and stroke this moon and sun
 although they are of such mighty power and majesty;
 and even as far as the Brahma-world
 may I have power in respect of my body,'[22],'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'By the purified deva-like hearing
 which surpasses that of men,
 may I hear both (kinds of) sounds  deva-like ones
 and human ones,
 whether they be far or near,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.[23]

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I know intuitively by mind
 the minds of other beings,[24]
 of other individuals,
 so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is full of attachment[25]
 that it is full of attachment;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is without attachment,
 that it is without attachment;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is full of aversion,
 that it is full of aversion;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is without aversion,
 that it is without [44] aversion;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is full of confusion,
 that it is full of confusion;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is without confusion,
 that it is without confusion;
 or or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is contracted
 that it is contracted;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is distracted
 that it is distracted;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that has become great
 that it has become great;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that has not become great
 that it has not become great;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it
 that it has (some other mental state) superior to it;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that has no (other mental state) superior to it
 that it has no (other mental state) superior to it;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 or of a mind that is composed
 that it is composed;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 or of a mind that is not composed
 that it is not composed;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 or of a mind that is freed
 that it is freed;
 or so that I may know intuitively
 of a mind that is not freed
 that it is not freed,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'May I recollect (my) manifold former habitations,[26] that is to say,
 one birth,
 two births,
 three births, four births, five births,
 ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births,
 a hundred births,
 a thousand births,
 a hundred thousand births,
 many an eon of integration,
 many an eon of disintegration,
 many an eon of integration-disintegration;
 such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this,
 I came to be in another state
 where such a one was I by name,
 having such and such a clan,
 such and such a colour,
 so was I nourished,
 such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,
 so did the span of life end.

 Passing from this I arose here.

 Thus may I remember (my) divers former habitations
 in all their modes and detail,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'With the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men,[27]
 may I behold beings
 as they pass hence
 or come to be  mean,
 excellent,
 fair,
 foul,
 in a good bourn,
 in a bad bourn,
 according to the consequences of their deeds;
 may I comprehend:

 Indeed these worthy beings
 were possessed of wrong conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 they were scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a wrong view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these,
 at the breaking up of the body after dying,
 have arisen in a sorrowful state,
 a bad bourn,
 the abyss,
 Niraya Hell.

 But these worthy beings
 who were possessed of good conduct in body,
 speech
 and thought,
 who were not scoffers at the ariyans,
 holding a right view,
 incurring deeds consequent on a right view - [45]
 these
 at the breaking up of the body after dying
 have arisen in a good bourn,
 a heaven world.

 Thus, with the purified deva-vision
 surpassing that of men
 may I behold beings
 as they pass hence,
 as they arise  mean,
 excellent,
 fair,
 foul,
 in a good bourn,
 in a bad bourn,
 according to the consequences of their deeds,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 Monks, if a monk should wish:

 'By the destruction of the cankers,[28]
 having realised by my own super-knowledge
 here and now
 the freedom of mind,[29]
 and freedom through wisdom[30]
 that are cankerless,
 entering thereon,
 may I abide therein,'

 he should be one who fulfils the moral habits,
 who is intent on mental tranquillity within,
 whose meditation is uninterrupted,
 who is endowed with vision,
 a cultivator of empty places.

 That of which I have spoken thus was spoken in relation to this:

 Fare along, monks, possessed of moral habit,
 possessed of the Obligations,
 fare along controlled by the control of the Obligations,
 possessed of right conduct and resort,
 seeing danger in the slightest faults;
 undertaking them rightly,
 train yourselves in the rules of training."

 Thus spoke the Lord.

 Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.
