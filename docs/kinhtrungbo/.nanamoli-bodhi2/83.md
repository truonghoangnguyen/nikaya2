###### 83 Makhadeva Sutta

 King Makhadeva

1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.[806] On one occasion, the Blessed One was
living at Mithila in the Makhadeva Mango Grove.[807 ]
2. Then in a certain place the Blessed One smiled. It occurred
to the venerable Ananda: "What is the reason, what is the cause,
for the Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no rea-
son." So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and
extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the
Blessed One, he asked him: "Venerable sir, what is the reason,
what is the cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not
smile for no reason."
3. "Once, Ananda, in this same Mithila there was a king
named Makhadeva. He was a righteous king who ruled by the
Dhamma, a great king who was established in the Dhamma.[808 ]
He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and
householders, among town-dwellers and countryfolk, and he
observed the Uposatha days [75] on the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and eighth of the fortnight.[809 ]

4. "Now at the end of many years, many hundred years, many
thousand years, King Makhadeva addressed his barber thus:
'Good barber, when you see any grey hairs growing on my
head, then tell me.' - 'Yes, sire,' he replied. And after many
years, many hundred years, many thousand years, the barber
saw grey hairs growing on King Makhadeva's head. [810] When he
saw them, he said to the king: 'The divine messengers have
appeared, sire; grey hairs are to be seen growing on your
majesty's head.' - "Then, good barber, pull out those grey hairs
carefully with tweezers and put them in my palm.' - 'Yes, sire,
he replied, and he pulled out those grey hairs carefully with
tweezers and put them in the king's palm.

"Then King Makhadeva gave the best township to his barber,
and calling the prince, his eldest son, he said: 'Dear prince, the
divine messengers have appeared;[811] grey hairs are seen growing
on my head. I have enjoyed human sensual pleasures; now it is
time to seek divine sensual pleasures. Come, dear prince, take
over the kingship. I shall shave off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness.
And now, dear prince, when you too see grey hairs growing on
your head, then after giving the best township to your barber,
and after carefully instructing the prince, your eldest son, in
kingship, shave off your hair and beard, put on the yellow robe,
and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Continue this
good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man. Dear
prince, when there are two men living, he under whom there
occurs a breach of this good practice - he is the last man among
them. Therefore, dear prince, I say to you: Continue this good
practice [76] instituted by me and do not be the last man.'
5. "Then, after giving the best township to his barber and after
carefully instructing the prince, his eldest son, in kingship, in
the Makhadeva Mango Grove he shaved off his hair and beard,
put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into
homelessness.
"He abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, like-
wise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and
to all as to himself, he abided pervading the all-encompassing
world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant,
exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.
"He abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
compassion...with a mind imbued with appreciative joy...with
a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise'
the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and
everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abided pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity,
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and with-
out ill will.
6. "For eighty-four thousand years King Makhadeva played
childish games; for eighty-four thousand years he acted as vice-
regent; for eighty-four thousand years he governed the kingdom;

for eighty-four thousand years he led the holy life in this
Makhadeva Mango Grove after shaving off his hair and beard,
putting on the yellow robe, and going forth from the home life
into homelessness. By developing the four divine abodes, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, he passed on to the
Brahma-world.
7-9. "Now at the end of many years, many hundred years,
many thousand years, King Makhadeva's son addressed his bar-
ber thus:...(as above, §§4-6, reading "King Makhadeva's son"
_throughout)...[77, 78]...By developing the four divine abodes, on_
the dissolution of the body, after death, he passed on to the
Brahma-world.
10. "The descendants of King Makhadeva's son to the number
of eighty-four thousand kings in succession, after shaving off
their hair and beard and putting on the yellow robe> went forth
from the home life into homelessness in this Makhadeva Mango
Grove. They abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with loving-kindness...with compassion...with appreciative
joy.. .with equanimity.. .without ill will.
11. "For eighty-four thousand years they played childish
games; for eighty-four thousand years they acted as vice-
regents; for eighty-four thousand years they governed the king-
dom; for eighty-four thousand years they led the holy life in this
Makhadeva Mango Grove after shaving off their hair and beard,
putting on the yellow robe, and going forth from the home life
into homelessness. By developing the four divine abodes, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, they passed on to the
Brahma-world.
12. "Nimi was the last of those kings. He was a righteous king
who ruled by the Dhamma, a great king who was established in
the Dhamma. He conducted himself by the Dhamma among
brahmins and householders, among town-dwellers and country-
folk, and he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth, fif-
teenth, and eighth of the fortnight.
13. "Once, Ananda, when the gods of the Thirty-three [79] had
met together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, this
discussion arose among them: 'It is a gain, sirs, for the people of
Videha, it is a great gain for the people of Videha that their King
Nimi is a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, a great king
who is established in the Dhamma. He conducts himself by the

Dhamma among brahmins and householders, among town-
dwellers and countryfolk, and he observes the Uposatha days
on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.'
"Then Sakka, ruler of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-
three: 'Good sirs, do you want to see King Nimi?' - 'Good sir,
we want to see King Nimi.'
"Now on that occasion, it being the Uposatha day of the fif-
teenth, King Nimi had washed his head and ascended to the
upper palace chamber, where he was seated for the Uposatha
observance. Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend
his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, Sakka, ruler of gods,
vanished among the gods of the Thirty-three and appeared in
the presence of King Nimi. He said: 'It is a gain for you, great
king, it is a great gain for you, great king. When the gods of the
Thirty-three had met together and were seated in the Su-
dhamma Assembly, this discussion arose among them: "It is a
gain, sirs, for the people of Videha...eighth of the fortnight."
Great king, the gods want to see you. I shall send a chariot har-
nessed to a thousand thoroughbreds for you, great king. Great
king, mount the divine chariot without misgiving.'
"King Nimi consented in silence. Then, just as quickly as a
strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended
arm, Sakka, ruler of gods, vanished in the presence of King
Nimi and appeared among the gods of the Thirty-three.
14. "Then Sakka, ruler of gods, addressed the charioteer
Matali thus: 'Come, good Matali, prepare a chariot harnessed to
a thousand thoroughbreds, and go to King Nimi and say: "Great
king, this chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has
been sent for you by Sakka, ruler of gods. Great king, mount the
divine [80] chariot without misgiving.'"
'"May your words be held sacred/ the charioteer Matali
replied. And having prepared a chariot harnessed to a thou-
sand thoroughbreds, he went to King Nimi and said: 'Great
king, this chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has
been sent for you by Sakka, ruler of gods. Great king, mount
the divine chariot without misgiving. But, great king, by which
route shall I drive you: by that on which doers of evil experi-
ence the results of evil actions, or by that on which doers of
good experience the results of good actions?' - 'Drive me by
both routes, Matali.'[812 ]

15. "Matali brought King Nimi to the Sudhamma Assembly.
Sakka, ruler of gods, saw King Nimi coming in the distance and
said to him: 'Come, great king! Welcome, great king! The gods
of the Thirty-three, great king, seated in the Sudhamma
Assembly, have expressed themselves thus: "It is a gain, sirs, for
the people of Videha...eighth of the fortnight." Great king, the
gods of the Thirty-three want to see you. Great king, enjoy
divine might among the gods.'
"'Enough, good sir. Let the charioteer drive me back to
Mithila. There I will conduct myself by the Dhamma among
brahmins and householders, among town-dwellers and country-
folk; there I will observe the Uposatha days on the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.'
16. "Then Sakka, ruler of gods, told the charioteer Matali:
'Come, good Matali, prepare the chariot harnessed to a thou-
sand thoroughbreds and drive King Nimi back to Mithila.'
'"May your word be held sacred,' the charioteer Matali
replied. And having prepared the chariot harnessed to a thou-
sand thoroughbreds, he drove King Nimi back to Mithila. And
there, indeed, King Nimi conducted himself by the Dhamma
among brahmins and householders, among town-dwellers and
countryfolk; and there [81] he observed the Uposatha days on
the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.
17-19. "Then at the end of many years, many hundred years,
many thousand years, King Nimi addressed his barber thus:
_...(as above, §§4-6, reading "King Nimi" throughout)... [82]... By_
developing the four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he passed on to the Brahma-world.
20. "Now King Nimi had a son named Kalarajanaka. He did
not go forth from the home life into homelessness. He broke that
good practice. He was the last man among them.
21. "Now, Ananda, it may be that you think thus: 'Certainly,
someone else was King Makhadeva on that occasion.' But it
should not be regarded thus. I was King Makhadeva on that
occasion. I instituted that good practice and later generations
continued that good practice instituted by me. But that kind of
good practice does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to
cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to
Nibbana, but only to reappearance in the Brahma-world. But
there is this kind of good practice that has been instituted by me

now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to dispassion, to
cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to
Nibbana. And what is that good practice? It is this Noble
Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, [83] right effort, right mindfulness,
and right concentration. This is the good practice instituted by
me now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to dispas-
sion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlighten-
ment, to Nibbana.
"Ananda, I say to you: continue this good practice instituted
by me and do not be the last man. Ananda, when there are two
men living, he under whom there occurs a breach of this good
practice - he is the last man among them. Therefore, Ananda, I
say to you: continue this good practice instituted by me and do
not be the last man." [813 ]

That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.
