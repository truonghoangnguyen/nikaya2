###### 52 Atthakanagara Sutta

 The Man from Atthakanagara

1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Venerable Ananda
was living at Beluvagamaka near Vesall.
2. Now on that occasion the householder Dasama of
Atthakanagara had arrived at Pataliputta for some business or
other. Then he went to a certain bhikkhu in Kukkuta's Park, and

**I' t**

after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and asked
him: "Where does the venerable Ananda live now, venerable
sir? I wish to see the venerable Ananda."
"The venerable Ananda is living at Beluvagamaka near Vesall,

i' ' i
! , householder."
<1 . 3. When the householder Dasama had completed his business
! 1,1 l' at Pataliputta, he went to the venerable Ananda at Beluva-
I'[1] ' gamaka near Vesall. After paying homage to him, he sat down

at one side and asked him:

1

"Venerable Ananda, has any one thing been proclaimed by

###### !! the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully

enlightened, wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and
resolute, his unliberated mind comes to be liberated, his unde-
stroyed taints come to be destroyed, and he attains the supreme

I I ' security from bondage that he had not attained before?"[550 ]
11 S| "Yes, householder, one such thing has been proclaimed by the

Blessed One." [350]

i i i(

"What is that one thing, venerable Ananda?"

###### fl .'i 4. "Here, householder, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,

secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and

###### \:

abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and

###### i sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion-

He considers this and understands it thus: 'This first jhana is

     - i conditioned and volitionally produced.[551] But whatever is con-

ditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent, subject to

M

cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the
taints.[552] But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints,
then because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the
phamma, [553] with the destruction of the five lower fetters he
becomes one due to reappear spontaneously [in the Pure
Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world.
"This is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows
and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated
mind comes to be liberated, his undestroyed taints come to be
destroyed, and he attains the supreme security from bondage
that he had not attained before.
5. "Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters and abides in the second jhana...He considers
this and understands it thus: 'This second jhana is conditioned
and volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and
volitionally produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.'
Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if
he does not attain the destruction of the taints...without ever
returning from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One [351]...
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
6. "Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhik-
khu...enters upon and abides in the third jhana...He considers
this and understands it thus: 'This third jhana is conditioned
and volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and
volitionally produced is-impermanent, subject to cessation.'
Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if
he does not attain the destruction of the taints...without ever
returning from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One...
Wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
7. "Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain...a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana.. .He consid-
ers this and understands it thus: 'This fourth jhana is conditioned

and volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and voli-
tionally produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing
upon that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does
not attain the destruction of the taints...without ever returning
from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One...
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
8. "Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a
mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second, like-
wise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and
everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-
encompassing world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without
ill will. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This deliver-
ance of mind through loving-kindness is conditioned and voli-
tionally produced. _But whatever is conditioned and volitionally_
produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon
that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not
attain the destruction of the taints.. .without ever returning from
that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One...
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
9. "Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a
mind imbued with compassion...without ill will. He considers
this and understands it thus: This deliverance of mind through
compassion is conditioned and volitionally produced. But what-
ever is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent,
subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the destruc-
tion of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the
taints.. .without ever returning from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One.-
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute..-he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
10. "Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a
mind imbued with appreciative joy...without ill will-

considers this and understands it thus: 'This deliverance of
mind through appreciative joy is conditioned and volitionally
produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced
is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he
attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the
destruction of the taints.. .without ever returning from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One...
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
11. "Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a
mind imbued with equanimity...without ill will. He considers
this and understands it thus: 'This deliverance of mind through
equanimity is conditioned and volitionally produced. But what-
ever is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent,

[352] subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the
destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction
of the taints.. .without ever returning from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One...
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
12. "Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of
form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact,
with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space
is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infi-
nite space. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This
attainment of the base of infinite space is conditioned and voli-
tionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally
produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon
that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not
attain the destruction of the taints.. .without ever returning from
that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One...
Wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
13. "Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the base of infinite consciousness. He considers

this and understands it thus: "This attainment of the base of infi.
nite consciousness is conditioned and volitionally produced. But
whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is imperma-
nent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the
destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of
the taints.. .without ever returning from that world.
"This too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One.,
wherein if a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute...he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before.
14. "Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. He considers this
and understands it thus: 'This attainment of the base of nothing-
ness is conditioned and volitionally produced. But whatever is
conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent, subject
to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of
the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints,
then because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the
Dhamma, with the destruction of the five lower fetters he
becomes one due to reappear spontaneously [in the Pure
Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world.
"This too^is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One who
knows and Sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein if
a bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated
mind comes to be liberated, his undestroyed taints come to be
destroyed, and he attains the supreme security from bondage
that he had not attained before."[554 ]

15. When venerable Ananda had spoken, the householder
Dasama of Atthakanagara said to him: "Venerable Ananda, just
as if a man seeking one entrance to a hidden treasure came all
at once upon eleven [353] entrances to a hidden treasure, so too,
while I was seeking one door to the Deathless, I have come all
at once to hear of eleven doors to the Deathless.[555] Just as if[ a ]
man had a house with eleven doors and when that house
caught on fire, he could flee to safety by any one of these eleven
doors, so I can flee to safety by any one of these eleven doors to
the Deathless. Venerable sir, these sectarians will even seek[ a ]

teacher's fee for their teachers; why shouldn't I make an offer-
ing to the venerable Ananda?"
16. Then the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara assem-
bled the Sangha of bhikkhus from Pataliputta and Vesali, and
with his own hands he served and satisfied them with various
kinds of good food. He presented a pair of cloths to each
bhikkhu, and he presented a triple robe to the venerable
Ananda, and he had a dwelling worth five hundred[556] built for
the venerable Ananda.
